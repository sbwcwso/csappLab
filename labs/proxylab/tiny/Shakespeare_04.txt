ut must be, will his free hours languish for 
Assured bondage?' 
IMOGEN 
Will my lord say so? 
IACHIMO 

Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter: 
It is a recreation to be by 
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know, 
Some men are much to blame. 
IMOGEN 
Not he, I hope. 
IACHIMO 
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might 
Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much; 
In you, which I account his beyond all talents, 
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound 
To pity too. 
IMOGEN 
What do you pity, sir? 
IACHIMO 
Two creatures heartily. 
IMOGEN 
Am I one, sir? 
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me 
Deserves your pity? 
IACHIMO 
Lamentable! What, 
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace 
I' the dungeon by a snuff? 
IMOGEN 
I pray you, sir, 

Deliver with more openness your answers 
To my demands. Why do you pity me? 
IACHIMO 
That others do-- 
I was about to say--enjoy your--But 
It is an office of the gods to venge it, 
Not mine to speak on 't. 
IMOGEN 
You do seem to know 
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,-- 
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more 
Than to be sure they do; for certainties 
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing, 
The remedy then born--discover to me 
What both you spur and stop. 
IACHIMO 
Had I this cheek 
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch, 
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul 
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which 
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye, 
Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then, 
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs 
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands 
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as 
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye 
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light 
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit 
That all the plagues of hell should at one time 
Encounter such revolt. 
IMOGEN 
My lord, I fear, 
Has forgot Britain. 

IACHIMO 
And himself. Not I, 
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce 
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces 
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue 
Charms this report out. 
IMOGEN 
Let me hear no more. 
IACHIMO 
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart 
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady 
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery, 
Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd 
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition 
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures 
That play with all infirmities for gold 
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff 
As well might poison poison! Be revenged; 
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you 
Recoil from your great stock. 
IMOGEN 
Revenged! 
How should I be revenged? If this be true,-- 
As I have such a heart that both mine ears 
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true, 
How should I be revenged? 
IACHIMO 
Should he make me 
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets, 
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps, 
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it. 
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure, 
More noble than that runagate to your bed, 

And will continue fast to your affection, 
Still close as sure. 
IMOGEN 
What, ho, Pisanio! 
IACHIMO 
Let me my service tender on your lips. 
IMOGEN 
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have 
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable, 
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not 
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange. 
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far 
From thy report as thou from honour, and 
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains 
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio! 
The king my father shall be made acquainted 
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit, 
A saucy stranger in his court to mart 
As in a Romish stew and to expound 
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court 
He little cares for and a daughter who 
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio! 
IACHIMO 
O happy Leonatus! I may say 
The credit that thy lady hath of thee 
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness 
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long! 
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever 
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only 
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon. 
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance 
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord, 
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one 
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch 

That he enchants societies into him; 
Half all men's hearts are his. 
IMOGEN 
You make amends. 
IACHIMO 
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god: 
He hath a kind of honour sets him off, 
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry, 
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured 
To try your taking a false report; which hath 
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment 
In the election of a sir so rare, 
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him 
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you, 
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon. 
IMOGEN 
All's well, sir: take my power i' the court 
for yours. 
IACHIMO 
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot 
To entreat your grace but in a small request, 
And yet of moment to, for it concerns 
Your lord; myself and other noble friends, 
Are partners in the business. 
IMOGEN 
Pray, what is't? 
IACHIMO 
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord-- 
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums 
To buy a present for the emperor 

Which I, the factor for the rest, have done 
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels 
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great; 
And I am something curious, being strange, 
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you 
To take them in protection? 
IMOGEN 
Willingly; 
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since 
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them 
In my bedchamber. 
IACHIMO 
They are in a trunk, 
Attended by my men: I will make bold 
To send them to you, only for this night; 
I must aboard to-morrow. 
IMOGEN 
O, no, no. 
IACHIMO 
Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word 
By lengthening my return. From Gallia 
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise 
To see your grace. 
IMOGEN 
I thank you for your pains: 
But not away to-morrow! 
IACHIMO 
O, I must, madam: 
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please 

To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night: 
I have outstood my time; which is material 
To the tender of our present. 
IMOGEN 
I will write. 
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept, 
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.

SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords 
CLOTEN 
Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the 
jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a 
hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes 
must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine 
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure. 
First Lord 
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with 
your bowl. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it, 
it would have run all out. 
CLOTEN 
When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for 
any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha? 
Second Lord 
No my lord; 
Aside 
nor crop the ears of them. 
CLOTEN 

Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? 
Would he had been one of my rank! 
Second Lord 
[Aside] To have smelt like a fool. 
CLOTEN 
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a 
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am; 
they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my 
mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of 
fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that 
nobody can match. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow, 
cock, with your comb on. 
CLOTEN 
Sayest thou? 
Second Lord 
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every 
companion that you give offence to. 
CLOTEN 
No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit 
offence to my inferiors. 
Second Lord 
Ay, it is fit for your lordship only. 
CLOTEN 

Why, so I say. 
First Lord 
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night? 
CLOTEN 
A stranger, and I not know on't! 
Second Lord 
[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it 
not. 
First Lord 
There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of 
Leonatus' friends. 
CLOTEN 
Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another, 
whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger? 
First Lord 
One of your lordship's pages. 
CLOTEN 
Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no 
derogation in't? 
Second Lord 
You cannot derogate, my lord. 
CLOTEN 

Not easily, I think. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your 
issues, being foolish, do not derogate. 
CLOTEN 
Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost 
to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go. 
Second Lord 
I'll attend your lordship. 
Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord 
That such a crafty devil as is his mother 
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that 
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son 
Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart, 
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess, 
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest, 
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd, 
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer 
More hateful than the foul expulsion is 
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act 
Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm 
The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked 
That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand, 
To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!

SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace: 
a trunk in one corner of it. 
IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending 
IMOGEN 
Who's there? my woman Helen? 
Lady 
Please you, madam 
IMOGEN 
What hour is it? 
Lady 
Almost midnight, madam. 
IMOGEN 
I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak: 
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed: 
Take not away the taper, leave it burning; 
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock, 
I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly 
Exit Lady 
To your protection I commend me, gods. 
From fairies and the tempters of the night 
Guard me, beseech ye. 

Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk 
IACHIMO 
The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense 
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus 
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd 
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea, 
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily, 
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch! 
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd, 
How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that 
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper 
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids, 
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied 
Under these windows, white and azure laced 
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design, 
To note the chamber: I will write all down: 
Such and such pictures; there the window; such 
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures, 
Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story. 
Ah, but some natural notes about her body, 
Above ten thousand meaner moveables 
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory. 
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her! 
And be her sense but as a monument, 
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off: 
Taking off her bracelet 
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard! 
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly, 
As strongly as the conscience does within, 
To the madding of her lord. On her left breast 
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops 
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher, 
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret 
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en 
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end? 
Why should I write this down, that's riveted, 
Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late 
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down 

Where Philomel gave up. I have enough: 
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it. 
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning 
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear; 
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here. 
Clock strikes 
One, two, three: time, time! 
Goes into the trunk. The scene closes 
Scene III 
An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments. 
Enter CLOTEN and Lords 
First Lord 
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the 
most coldest that ever turned up ace. 
CLOTEN 
It would make any man cold to lose. 
First Lord 
But not every man patient after the noble temper of 
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win. 
CLOTEN 
Winning will put any man into courage. If I could 
get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. 
It's almost morning, is't not? 
First Lord 
Day, my lord. 

CLOTEN 
I would this music would come: I am advised to give 
her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate. 
Enter Musicians 
Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your 
fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none 
will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er. 
First, a very excellent good-conceited thing; 
after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich 
words to it: and then let her consider. 
SONG 
Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings, 
And Phoebus 'gins arise, 
His steeds to water at those springs 
On chaliced flowers that lies; 
And winking Mary-buds begin 
To ope their golden eyes: 
With every thing that pretty is, 
My lady sweet, arise: 
Arise, arise. 
CLOTEN 
So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will 
consider your music the better: if it do not, it is 
a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and 
calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to 
boot, can never amend. 
Exeunt Musicians 
Second Lord 
Here comes the king. 
CLOTEN 

I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I 
was up so early: he cannot choose but take this 
service I have done fatherly. 
Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN 
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother. 
CYMBELINE 
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter? 
Will she not forth? 
CLOTEN 
I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice. 
CYMBELINE 
The exile of her minion is too new; 
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time 
Must wear the print of his remembrance out, 
And then she's yours. 
QUEEN 
You are most bound to the king, 
Who lets go by no vantages that may 
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself 
To orderly soliciting, and be friended 
With aptness of the season; make denials 
Increase your services; so seem as if 
You were inspired to do those duties which 
You tender to her; that you in all obey her, 
Save when command to your dismission tends, 
And therein you are senseless. 
CLOTEN 
Senseless! not so. 

Enter a Messenger 
Messenger 
So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome; 
The one is Caius Lucius. 
CYMBELINE 
A worthy fellow, 
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now; 
But that's no fault of his: we must receive him 
According to the honour of his sender; 
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us, 
We must extend our notice. Our dear son, 
When you have given good morning to your mistress, 
Attend the queen and us; we shall have need 
To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen. 
Exeunt all but CLOTEN 
CLOTEN 
If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not, 
Let her lie still and dream. 
Knocks 
By your leave, ho! 
I Know her women are about her: what 
If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold 
Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes 
Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up 
Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold 
Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief; 
Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what 
Can it not do and undo? I will make 
One of her women lawyer to me, for 
I yet not understand the case myself. 
Knocks 

By your leave. 
Enter a Lady 
Lady 
Who's there that knocks? 
CLOTEN 
A gentleman. 
Lady 
No more? 
CLOTEN 
Yes, and a gentlewoman's son. 
Lady 
That's more 
Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours, 
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure? 
CLOTEN 
Your lady's person: is she ready? 
Lady 
Ay, 
To keep her chamber. 
CLOTEN 
There is gold for you; 
Sell me your good report. 
Lady 

How! my good name? or to report of you 
What I shall think is good?--The princess! 
Enter IMOGEN 
CLOTEN 
Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand. 
Exit Lady 
IMOGEN 
Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains 
For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give 
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks 
And scarce can spare them. 
CLOTEN 
Still, I swear I love you. 
IMOGEN 
If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me: 
If you swear still, your recompense is still 
That I regard it not. 
CLOTEN 
This is no answer. 
IMOGEN 
But that you shall not say I yield being silent, 
I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith, 
I shall unfold equal discourtesy 
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing 
Should learn, being taught, forbearance. 

CLOTEN 
To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin: 
I will not. 
IMOGEN 
Fools are not mad folks. 
CLOTEN 
Do you call me fool? 
IMOGEN 
As I am mad, I do: 
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad; 
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir, 
You put me to forget a lady's manners, 
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all, 
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce, 
By the very truth of it, I care not for you, 
And am so near the lack of charity-- 
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather 
You felt than make't my boast. 
CLOTEN 
You sin against 
Obedience, which you owe your father. For 
The contract you pretend with that base wretch, 
One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes, 
With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none: 
And though it be allow'd in meaner parties-- 
Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls, 
On whom there is no more dependency 
But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot; 
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by 
The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil 
The precious note of it with a base slave. 
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth, 
A pantler, not so eminent. 

IMOGEN 
Profane fellow 
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more 
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base 
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough, 
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made 
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled 
The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated 
For being preferred so well. 
CLOTEN 
The south-fog rot him! 
IMOGEN 
He never can meet more mischance than come 
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment, 
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer 
In my respect than all the hairs above thee, 
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio! 
Enter PISANIO 
CLOTEN 
'His garment!' Now the devil-- 
IMOGEN 
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently-- 
CLOTEN 
'His garment!' 
IMOGEN 
I am sprited with a fool. 

Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman 
Search for a jewel that too casually 
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me, 
If I would lose it for a revenue 
Of any king's in Europe. I do think 
I saw't this morning: confident I am 
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it: 
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord 
That I kiss aught but he. 
PISANIO 
'Twill not be lost. 
IMOGEN 
I hope so: go and search. 
Exit PISANIO 
CLOTEN 
You have abused me: 
'His meanest garment!' 
IMOGEN 
Ay, I said so, sir: 
If you will make't an action, call witness to't. 
CLOTEN 
I will inform your father. 
IMOGEN 
Your mother too: 
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope, 
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir, 
To the worst of discontent. 

Exit 
CLOTEN 
I'll be revenged: 
'His meanest garment!' Well.

SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house. 
Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure 
To win the king as I am bold her honour 
Will remain hers. 
PHILARIO 
What means do you make to him? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Not any, but abide the change of time, 
Quake in the present winter's state and wish 
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes, 
I barely gratify your love; they failing, 
I must die much your debtor. 
PHILARIO 
Your very goodness and your company 
O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king 
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius 
Will do's commission throughly: and I think 
He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages, 
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance 
Is yet fresh in their grief. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
I do believe, 
Statist though I am none, nor like to be, 

That this will prove a war; and you shall hear 
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed 
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings 
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen 
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar 
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found 
their courage 
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline, 
Now mingled with their courages, will make known 
To their approvers they are people such 
That mend upon the world. 
Enter IACHIMO 
PHILARIO 
See! Iachimo! 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
The swiftest harts have posted you by land; 
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails, 
To make your vessel nimble. 
PHILARIO 
Welcome, sir. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
I hope the briefness of your answer made 
The speediness of your return. 
IACHIMO 
Your lady 
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty 

Look through a casement to allure false hearts 
And be false with them. 
IACHIMO 
Here are letters for you. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Their tenor good, I trust. 
IACHIMO 
'Tis very like. 
PHILARIO 
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court 
When you were there? 
IACHIMO 
He was expected then, 
But not approach'd. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
All is well yet. 
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not 
Too dull for your good wearing? 
IACHIMO 
If I had lost it, 
I should have lost the worth of it in gold. 
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy 
A second night of such sweet shortness which 
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 

The stone's too hard to come by. 
IACHIMO 
Not a whit, 
Your lady being so easy. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Make not, sir, 
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we 
Must not continue friends. 
IACHIMO 
Good sir, we must, 
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought 
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant 
We were to question further: but I now 
Profess myself the winner of her honour, 
Together with your ring; and not the wronger 
Of her or you, having proceeded but 
By both your wills. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
If you can make't apparent 
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand 
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion 
You had of her pure honour gains or loses 
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both 
To who shall find them. 
IACHIMO 
Sir, my circumstances, 
Being so near the truth as I will make them, 
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength 
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not, 
You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find 
You need it not. 

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Proceed. 
IACHIMO 
First, her bedchamber,-- 
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess 
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd 
With tapesty of silk and silver; the story 
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman, 
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for 
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work 
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive 
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd 
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought, 
Since the true life on't was-- 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
This is true; 
And this you might have heard of here, by me, 
Or by some other. 
IACHIMO 
More particulars 
Must justify my knowledge. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
So they must, 
Or do your honour injury. 
IACHIMO 
The chimney 
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece 
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures 
So likely to report themselves: the cutter 
Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her, 
Motion and breath left out. 

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
This is a thing 
Which you might from relation likewise reap, 
Being, as it is, much spoke of. 
IACHIMO 
The roof o' the chamber 
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons-- 
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids 
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely 
Depending on their brands. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
This is her honour! 
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise 
Be given to your remembrance--the description 
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves 
The wager you have laid. 
IACHIMO 
Then, if you can, 
Showing the bracelet 
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see! 
And now 'tis up again: it must be married 
To that your diamond; I'll keep them. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Jove! 
Once more let me behold it: is it that 
Which I left with her? 
IACHIMO 

Sir--I thank her--that: 
She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet; 
Her pretty action did outsell her gift, 
And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said 
She prized it once. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
May be she pluck'd it off 
To send it me. 
IACHIMO 
She writes so to you, doth she? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too; 
Gives the ring 
It is a basilisk unto mine eye, 
Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour 
Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love, 
Where there's another man: the vows of women 
Of no more bondage be, to where they are made, 
Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing. 
O, above measure false! 
PHILARIO 
Have patience, sir, 
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won: 
It may be probable she lost it; or 
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted, 
Hath stol'n it from her? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Very true; 
And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring: 
Render to me some corporal sign about her, 

More evident than this; for this was stolen. 
IACHIMO 
By Jupiter, I had it from her arm. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears. 
'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure 
She would not lose it: her attendants are 
All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it! 
And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her: 
The cognizance of her incontinency 
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore 
thus dearly. 
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell 
Divide themselves between you! 
PHILARIO 
Sir, be patient: 
This is not strong enough to be believed 
Of one persuaded well of-- 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Never talk on't; 
She hath been colted by him. 
IACHIMO 
If you seek 
For further satisfying, under her breast-- 
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud 
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life, 
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger 
To feed again, though full. You do remember 
This stain upon her? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 

Ay, and it doth confirm 
Another stain, as big as hell can hold, 
Were there no more but it. 
IACHIMO 
Will you hear more? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns; 
Once, and a million! 
IACHIMO 
I'll be sworn-- 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
No swearing. 
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie; 
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny 
Thou'st made me cuckold. 
IACHIMO 
I'll deny nothing. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal! 
I will go there and do't, i' the court, before 
Her father. I'll do something-- 
Exit 
PHILARIO 
Quite besides 
The government of patience! You have won: 
Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath 

He hath against himself. 
IACHIMO 
With an my heart.

SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house. 
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Is there no way for men to be but women 
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards; 
And that most venerable man which I 
Did call my father, was I know not where 
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools 
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd 
The Dian of that time so doth my wife 
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance! 
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd 
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with 
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't 
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her 
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils! 
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?-- 
Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but, 
Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one, 
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition 
But what he look'd for should oppose and she 
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out 
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion 
That tends to vice in man, but I affirm 
It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it, 
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers; 
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers; 
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain, 
Nice longing, slanders, mutability, 
All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows, 
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all; 
For even to vice 
They are not constant but are changing still 
One vice, but of a minute old, for one 

Not half so old as that. I'll write against them, 
Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill 
In a true hate, to pray they have their will: 
The very devils cannot plague them better.

SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and Lords at one door, and at another, 
CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants 
CYMBELINE 
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us? 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet 
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues 
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain 
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,-- 
Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less 
Than in his feats deserving it--for him 
And his succession granted Rome a tribute, 
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately 
Is left untender'd. 
QUEEN 
And, to kill the marvel, 
Shall be so ever. 
CLOTEN 
There be many Caesars, 
Ere such another Julius. Britain is 
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay 
For wearing our own noses. 
QUEEN 
That opportunity 

Which then they had to take from 's, to resume 
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege, 
The kings your ancestors, together with 
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands 
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in 
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters, 
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats, 
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest 
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag 
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame-- 
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried 
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping-- 
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas, 
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd 
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof 
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point-- 
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword, 
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright 
And Britons strut with courage. 
CLOTEN 
Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our 
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and, 
as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of 
them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such 
straight arms, none. 
CYMBELINE 
Son, let your mother end. 
CLOTEN 
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as 
Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a 
hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If 
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or 
put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute 
for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now. 
CYMBELINE 

You must know, 
Till the injurious Romans did extort 
This tribute from us, we were free: 
Caesar's ambition, 
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch 
The sides o' the world, against all colour here 
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off 
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon 
Ourselves to be. 
CLOTEN Lords 
We do. 
CYMBELINE 
Say, then, to Caesar, 
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which 
Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar 
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise 
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed, 
Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws, 
Who was the first of Britain which did put 
His brows within a golden crown and call'd 
Himself a king. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
I am sorry, Cymbeline, 
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar-- 
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than 
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy: 
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion 
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look 
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied, 
I thank thee for myself. 
CYMBELINE 
Thou art welcome, Caius. 
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent 

Much under him; of him I gather'd honour; 
Which he to seek of me again, perforce, 
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect 
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for 
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent 
Which not to read would show the Britons cold: 
So Caesar shall not find them. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Let proof speak. 
CLOTEN 
His majesty bids you welcome. Make 
pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if 
you seek us afterwards in other terms, you 
shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you 
beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in 
the adventure, our crows shall fare the better 
for you; and there's an end. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
So, sir. 
CYMBELINE 
I know your master's pleasure and he mine: 
All the remain is 'Welcome!'

SCENE II. Another room in the palace. 
Enter PISANIO, with a letter 
PISANIO 
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not 
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus, 
O master! what a strange infection 
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian, 
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd 
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No: 
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes, 
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults 
As would take in some virtue. O my master! 
Thy mind to her is now as low as were 
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her? 
Upon the love and truth and vows which I 
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood? 
If it be so to do good service, never 
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I, 
That I should seem to lack humanity 
so much as this fact comes to? 
Reading 
'Do't: the letter 
that I have sent her, by her own command 
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper! 
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble, 
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st 
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes. 
I am ignorant in what I am commanded. 
Enter IMOGEN 

IMOGEN 
How now, Pisanio! 
PISANIO 
Madam, here is a letter from my lord. 
IMOGEN 
Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus! 
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer 
That knew the stars as I his characters; 
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods, 
Let what is here contain'd relish of love, 
Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not 
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him: 
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them, 
For it doth physic love: of his content, 
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be 
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers 
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike: 
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet 
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods! 
Reads 
'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me 
in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as 
you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me 
with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, 
at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of 
this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all 
happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your, 
increasing in love, 
LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.' 
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio? 
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me 
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs 
May plod it in a week, why may not I 
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,-- 
Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,-- 

let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st, 
But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me; 
For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick; 
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing, 
To the smothering of the sense--how far it is 
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way 
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as 
To inherit such a haven: but first of all, 
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap 
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going 
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence: 
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot? 
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak, 
How many score of miles may we well ride 
'Twixt hour and hour? 
PISANIO 
One score 'twixt sun and sun, 
Madam, 's enough for you: 
Aside 
and too much too. 
IMOGEN 
Why, one that rode to's execution, man, 
Could never go so slow: I have heard of 
riding wagers, 
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands 
That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery: 
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say 
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently 
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit 
A franklin's housewife. 
PISANIO 
Madam, you're best consider. 
IMOGEN 

I see before me, man: nor here, nor here, 
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them, 
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee; 
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say, 
Accessible is none but Milford way.

SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave. 
Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following 
BELARIUS 
A goodly day not to keep house, with such 
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate 
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you 
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs 
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through 
And keep their impious turbans on, without 
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven! 
We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly 
As prouder livers do. 
GUIDERIUS 
Hail, heaven! 
ARVIRAGUS 
Hail, heaven! 
BELARIUS 
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill; 
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider, 
When you above perceive me like a crow, 
That it is place which lessens and sets off; 
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you 
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war: 
This service is not service, so being done, 
But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus, 
Draws us a profit from all things we see; 
And often, to our comfort, shall we find 

The sharded beetle in a safer hold 
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life 
Is nobler than attending for a cheque, 
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble, 
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk: 
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine, 
Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours. 
GUIDERIUS 
Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged, 
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not 
What air's from home. Haply this life is best, 
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you 
That have a sharper known; well corresponding 
With your stiff age: but unto us it is 
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed; 
A prison for a debtor, that not dares 
To stride a limit. 
ARVIRAGUS 
What should we speak of 
When we are old as you? when we shall hear 
The rain and wind beat dark December, how, 
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse 
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing; 
We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey, 
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat; 
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage 
We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird, 
And sing our bondage freely. 
BELARIUS 
How you speak! 
Did you but know the city's usuries 
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court 
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb 
Is certain falling, or so slippery that 
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war, 
A pain that only seems to seek out danger 

I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i' 
the search, 
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph 
As record of fair act; nay, many times, 
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse, 
Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story 
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd 
With Roman swords, and my report was once 
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me, 
And when a soldier was the theme, my name 
Was not far off: then was I as a tree 
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night, 
A storm or robbery, call it what you will, 
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves, 
And left me bare to weather. 
GUIDERIUS 
Uncertain favour! 
BELARIUS 
My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft-- 
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd 
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline 
I was confederate with the Romans: so 
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years 
This rock and these demesnes have been my world; 
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid 
More pious debts to heaven than in all 
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains! 
This is not hunters' language: he that strikes 
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast; 
To him the other two shall minister; 
And we will fear no poison, which attends 
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys. 
Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS 
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! 
These boys know little they are sons to the king; 
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive. 

They think they are mine; and though train'd 
up thus meanly 
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit 
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them 
In simple and low things to prince it much 
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore, 
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who 
The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove! 
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell 
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out 
Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell, 
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then 
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, 
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture 
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal, 
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure, 
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more 
His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused! 
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows 
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon, 
At three and two years old, I stole these babes; 
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as 
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile, 
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for 
their mother, 
And every day do honour to her grave: 
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd, 
They take for natural father. The game is up.

SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven. 
Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN 
IMOGEN 
Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place 
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so 
To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man! 
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind, 
That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh 
From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus, 
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd 
Beyond self-explication: put thyself 
Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness 
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter? 
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with 
A look untender? If't be summer news, 
Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st 
But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand! 
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him, 
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue 
May take off some extremity, which to read 
Would be even mortal to me. 
PISANIO 
Please you, read; 
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing 
The most disdain'd of fortune. 
IMOGEN 
[Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the 
strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie 
bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, 

but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain 
as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, 
must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with 
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away 
her life: I shall give thee opportunity at 
Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose 
where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain 
it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and 
equally to me disloyal.' 
PISANIO 
What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper 
Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander, 
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue 
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath 
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie 
All corners of the world: kings, queens and states, 
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave 
This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam? 
IMOGEN 
False to his bed! What is it to be false? 
To lie in watch there and to think on him? 
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep 
charge nature, 
To break it with a fearful dream of him 
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it? 
PISANIO 
Alas, good lady! 
IMOGEN 
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo, 
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency; 
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks 
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy 
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him: 
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion; 

And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls, 
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O, 
Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming, 
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought 
Put on for villany; not born where't grows, 
But worn a bait for ladies. 
PISANIO 
Good madam, hear me. 
IMOGEN 
True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas, 
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping 
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity 
From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus, 
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men; 
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured 
From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest: 
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him, 
A little witness my obedience: look! 
I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit 
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart; 
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief; 
Thy master is not there, who was indeed 
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike 
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause; 
But now thou seem'st a coward. 
PISANIO 
Hence, vile instrument! 
Thou shalt not damn my hand. 
IMOGEN 
Why, I must die; 
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art 
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter 
There is a prohibition so divine 
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart. 

Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence; 
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here? 
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus, 
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away, 
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more 
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools 
Believe false teachers: though those that 
are betray'd 
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor 
Stands in worse case of woe. 
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up 
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father 
And make me put into contempt the suits 
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find 
It is no act of common passage, but 
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself 
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her 
That now thou tirest on, how thy memory 
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch: 
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife? 
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding, 
When I desire it too. 
PISANIO 
O gracious lady, 
Since I received command to do this business 
I have not slept one wink. 
IMOGEN 
Do't, and to bed then. 
PISANIO 
I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first. 
IMOGEN 
Wherefore then 
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused 
So many miles with a pretence? this place? 

Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour? 
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court, 
For my being absent? whereunto I never 
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far, 
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand, 
The elected deer before thee? 
PISANIO 
But to win time 
To lose so bad employment; in the which 
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady, 
Hear me with patience. 
IMOGEN 
Talk thy tongue weary; speak 
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear 
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound, 
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak. 
PISANIO 
Then, madam, 
I thought you would not back again. 
IMOGEN 
Most like; 
Bringing me here to kill me. 
PISANIO 
Not so, neither: 
But if I were as wise as honest, then 
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be 
But that my master is abused: 
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art. 
Hath done you both this cursed injury. 
IMOGEN 

Some Roman courtezan. 
PISANIO 
No, on my life. 
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him 
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded 
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court, 
And that will well confirm it. 
IMOGEN 
Why good fellow, 
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live? 
Or in my life what comfort, when I am 
Dead to my husband? 
PISANIO 
If you'll back to the court-- 
IMOGEN 
No court, no father; nor no more ado 
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing, 
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me 
As fearful as a siege. 
PISANIO 
If not at court, 
Then not in Britain must you bide. 
IMOGEN 
Where then 
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night, 
Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume 
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't; 
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think 
There's livers out of Britain. 

PISANIO 
I am most glad 
You think of other place. The ambassador, 
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven 
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind 
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise 
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be 
But by self-danger, you should tread a course 
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near 
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least 
That though his actions were not visible, yet 
Report should render him hourly to your ear 
As truly as he moves. 
IMOGEN 
O, for such means! 
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't, 
I would adventure. 
PISANIO 
Well, then, here's the point: 
You must forget to be a woman; change 
Command into obedience: fear and niceness-- 
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly, 
Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage: 
Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and 
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must 
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek, 
Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart! 
Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch 
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget 
Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein 
You made great Juno angry. 
IMOGEN 
Nay, be brief 
I see into thy end, and am almost 
A man already. 

PISANIO 
First, make yourself but like one. 
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit-- 
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all 
That answer to them: would you in their serving, 
And with what imitation you can borrow 
From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius 
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him 
wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know, 
If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless 
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable 
And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad, 
You have me, rich; and I will never fail 
Beginning nor supplyment. 
IMOGEN 
Thou art all the comfort 
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away: 
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even 
All that good time will give us: this attempt 
I am soldier to, and will abide it with 
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee. 
PISANIO 
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell, 
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of 
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress, 
Here is a box; I had it from the queen: 
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea, 
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this 
Will drive away distemper. To some shade, 
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods 
Direct you to the best! 
IMOGEN 
Amen: I thank thee.

SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants 
CYMBELINE 
Thus far; and so farewell. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Thanks, royal sir. 
My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence; 
And am right sorry that I must report ye 
My master's enemy. 
CYMBELINE 
Our subjects, sir, 
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself 
To show less sovereignty than they, must needs 
Appear unkinglike. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
So, sir: I desire of you 
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven. 
Madam, all joy befal your grace! 
QUEEN 
And you! 
CYMBELINE 
My lords, you are appointed for that office; 
The due of honour in no point omit. 

So farewell, noble Lucius. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Your hand, my lord. 
CLOTEN 
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth 
I wear it as your enemy. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Sir, the event 
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well. 
CYMBELINE 
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, 
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness! 
Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords 
QUEEN 
He goes hence frowning: but it honours us 
That we have given him cause. 
CLOTEN 
'Tis all the better; 
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it. 
CYMBELINE 
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor 
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely 
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness: 
The powers that he already hath in Gallia 
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves 
His war for Britain. 

QUEEN 
'Tis not sleepy business; 
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly. 
CYMBELINE 
Our expectation that it would be thus 
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen, 
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd 
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd 
The duty of the day: she looks us like 
A thing more made of malice than of duty: 
We have noted it. Call her before us; for 
We have been too slight in sufferance. 
Exit an Attendant 
QUEEN 
Royal sir, 
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired 
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord, 
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty, 
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady 
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes 
And strokes death to her. 
Re-enter Attendant 
CYMBELINE 
Where is she, sir? How 
Can her contempt be answer'd? 
Attendant 
Please you, sir, 
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer 
That will be given to the loudest noise we make. 

QUEEN 
My lord, when last I went to visit her, 
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close, 
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity, 
She should that duty leave unpaid to you, 
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this 
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court 
Made me to blame in memory. 
CYMBELINE 
Her doors lock'd? 
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear 
Prove false! 
Exit 
QUEEN 
Son, I say, follow the king. 
CLOTEN 
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant, 
have not seen these two days. 
QUEEN 
Go, look after. 
Exit CLOTEN 
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus! 
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence 
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes 
It is a thing most precious. But for her, 
Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her, 
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown 
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is 
To death or to dishonour; and my end 
Can make good use of either: she being down, 

I have the placing of the British crown. 
Re-enter CLOTEN 
How now, my son! 
CLOTEN 
'Tis certain she is fled. 
Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none 
Dare come about him. 
QUEEN 
[Aside] All the better: may 
This night forestall him of the coming day! 
Exit 
CLOTEN 
I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal, 
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite 
Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one 
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded, 
Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but 
Disdaining me and throwing favours on 
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment 
That what's else rare is choked; and in that point 
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed, 
To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall-- 
Enter PISANIO 
Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah? 
Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain, 
Where is thy lady? In a word; or else 
Thou art straightway with the fiends. 
PISANIO 

O, good my lord! 
CLOTEN 
Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,-- 
I will not ask again. Close villain, 
I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip 
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus? 
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot 
A dram of worth be drawn. 
PISANIO 
Alas, my lord, 
How can she be with him? When was she missed? 
He is in Rome. 
CLOTEN 
Where is she, sir? Come nearer; 
No further halting: satisfy me home 
What is become of her. 
PISANIO 
O, my all-worthy lord! 
CLOTEN 
All-worthy villain! 
Discover where thy mistress is at once, 
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!' 
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is 
Thy condemnation and thy death. 
PISANIO 
Then, sir, 
This paper is the history of my knowledge 
Touching her flight. 

Presenting a letter 
CLOTEN 
Let's see't. I will pursue her 
Even to Augustus' throne. 
PISANIO 
[Aside] Or this, or perish. 
She's far enough; and what he learns by this 
May prove his travel, not her danger. 
CLOTEN 
Hum! 
PISANIO 
[Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen, 
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again! 
CLOTEN 
Sirrah, is this letter true? 
PISANIO 
Sir, as I think. 
CLOTEN 
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou 
wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, 
undergo those employments wherein I should have 
cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is, 
what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it 
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest 
man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy 
relief nor my voice for thy preferment. 

PISANIO 
Well, my good lord. 
CLOTEN 
Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and 
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of 
that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the 
course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of 
mine: wilt thou serve me? 
PISANIO 
Sir, I will. 
CLOTEN 
Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy 
late master's garments in thy possession? 
PISANIO 
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he 
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress. 
CLOTEN 
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit 
hither: let it be thy lint service; go. 
PISANIO 
I shall, my lord. 
Exit 
CLOTEN 
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one 
thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou 

villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these 
garments were come. She said upon a time--the 
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she 
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect 
than my noble and natural person together with the 
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my 
back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her 
eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then 
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my 
speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and 
when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex 
her I will execute in the clothes that she so 
praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot 
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly, 
and I'll be merry in my revenge. 
Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes 
Be those the garments? 
PISANIO 
Ay, my noble lord. 
CLOTEN 
How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven? 
PISANIO 
She can scarce be there yet. 
CLOTEN 
Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second 
thing that I have commanded thee: the third is, 
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be 
but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself 
to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had 
wings to follow it! Come, and be true. 
Exit 

PISANIO 
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee 
Were to prove false, which I will never be, 
To him that is most true. To Milford go, 
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow, 
You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed 
Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!

SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius. 
Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes 
IMOGEN 
I see a man's life is a tedious one: 
I have tired myself, and for two nights together 
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick, 
But that my resolution helps me. Milford, 
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee, 
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think 
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, 
Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me 
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie, 
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis 
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder, 
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness 
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood 
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord! 
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee, 
My hunger's gone; but even before, I was 
At point to sink for food. But what is this? 
Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold: 
I were best not to call; I dare not call: 
yet famine, 
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant, 
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever 
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here? 
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage, 
Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter. 
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy 
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't. 
Such a foe, good heavens! 
Exit, to the cave 

Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 
BELARIUS 
You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and 
Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I 
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match: 
The sweat of industry would dry and die, 
But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs 
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness 
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth 
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here, 
Poor house, that keep'st thyself! 
GUIDERIUS 
I am thoroughly weary. 
ARVIRAGUS 
I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite. 
GUIDERIUS 
There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that, 
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd. 
BELARIUS 
[Looking into the cave] 
Stay; come not in. 
But that it eats our victuals, I should think 
Here were a fairy. 
GUIDERIUS 
What's the matter, sir? 
BELARIUS 
By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not, 

An earthly paragon! Behold divineness 
No elder than a boy! 
Re-enter IMOGEN 
IMOGEN 
Good masters, harm me not: 
Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought 
To have begg'd or bought what I have took: 
good troth, 
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found 
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat: 
I would have left it on the board so soon 
As I had made my meal, and parted 
With prayers for the provider. 
GUIDERIUS 
Money, youth? 
ARVIRAGUS 
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt! 
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those 
Who worship dirty gods. 
IMOGEN 
I see you're angry: 
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should 
Have died had I not made it. 
BELARIUS 
Whither bound? 
IMOGEN 
To Milford-Haven. 

BELARIUS 
What's your name? 
IMOGEN 
Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who 
Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford; 
To whom being going, almost spent with hunger, 
I am fall'n in this offence. 
BELARIUS 
Prithee, fair youth, 
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds 
By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd! 
'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer 
Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it. 
Boys, bid him welcome. 
GUIDERIUS 
Were you a woman, youth, 
I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty, 
I bid for you as I'd buy. 
ARVIRAGUS 
I'll make't my comfort 
He is a man; I'll love him as my brother: 
And such a welcome as I'd give to him 
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome! 
Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends. 
IMOGEN 
'Mongst friends, 
If brothers. 
Aside 

Would it had been so, that they 
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize 
Been less, and so more equal ballasting 
To thee, Posthumus. 
BELARIUS 
He wrings at some distress. 
GUIDERIUS 
Would I could free't! 
ARVIRAGUS 
Or I, whate'er it be, 
What pain it cost, what danger. God's! 
BELARIUS 
Hark, boys. 
Whispering 
IMOGEN 
Great men, 
That had a court no bigger than this cave, 
That did attend themselves and had the virtue 
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by 
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes-- 
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods! 
I'd change my sex to be companion with them, 
Since Leonatus's false. 
BELARIUS 
It shall be so. 
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in: 
Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd, 
We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story, 

So far as thou wilt speak it. 
GUIDERIUS 
Pray, draw near. 
ARVIRAGUS 
The night to the owl and morn to the lark 
less welcome. 
IMOGEN 
Thanks, sir. 
ARVIRAGUS 
I pray, draw near.

SCENE VII. Rome. A public place. 
Enter two Senators and Tribunes 
First Senator 
This is the tenor of the emperor's writ: 
That since the common men are now in action 
'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians, 
And that the legions now in Gallia are 
Full weak to undertake our wars against 
The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite 
The gentry to this business. He creates 
Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes, 
For this immediate levy, he commends 
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar! 
First Tribune 
Is Lucius general of the forces? 
Second Senator 
Ay. 
First Tribune 
Remaining now in Gallia? 
First Senator 
With those legions 
Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy 
Must be supplyant: the words of your commission 
Will tie you to the numbers and the time 
Of their dispatch. 

First Tribune 
We will discharge our duty.

SCENE I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius. 
Enter CLOTEN 
CLOTEN 
I am near to the place where they should meet, if 
Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments 
serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by 
him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the 
rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said 
a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must 
play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it 
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer 
in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are 
as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, 
not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the 
advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike 
conversant in general services, and more remarkable 
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant 
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! 
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy 
shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy 
mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before 
thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her 
father; who may haply be a little angry for my so 
rough usage; but my mother, having power of his 
testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My 
horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore 
purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is 
the very description of their meeting-place; and 
the fellow dares not deceive me.

SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius. 
Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN 
BELARIUS 
[To IMOGEN] You are not well: remain here in the cave; 
We'll come to you after hunting. 
ARVIRAGUS 
[To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here 
Are we not brothers? 
IMOGEN 
So man and man should be; 
But clay and clay differs in dignity, 
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick. 
GUIDERIUS 
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him. 
IMOGEN 
So sick I am not, yet I am not well; 
But not so citizen a wanton as 
To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me; 
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom 
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me 
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort 
To one not sociable: I am not very sick, 
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here: 
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die, 
Stealing so poorly. 

GUIDERIUS 
I love thee; I have spoke it 
How much the quantity, the weight as much, 
As I do love my father. 
BELARIUS 
What! how! how! 
ARVIRAGUS 
If it be sin to say so, I yoke me 
In my good brother's fault: I know not why 
I love this youth; and I have heard you say, 
Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door, 
And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say 
'My father, not this youth.' 
BELARIUS 
[Aside] O noble strain! 
O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness! 
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base: 
Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace. 
I'm not their father; yet who this should be, 
Doth miracle itself, loved before me. 
'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Brother, farewell. 
IMOGEN 
I wish ye sport. 
ARVIRAGUS 
You health. So please you, sir. 

IMOGEN 
[Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies 
I have heard! 
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court: 
Experience, O, thou disprovest report! 
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish 
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish. 
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio, 
I'll now taste of thy drug. 
Swallows some 
GUIDERIUS 
I could not stir him: 
He said he was gentle, but unfortunate; 
Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter 
I might know more. 
BELARIUS 
To the field, to the field! 
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest. 
ARVIRAGUS 
We'll not be long away. 
BELARIUS 
Pray, be not sick, 
For you must be our housewife. 
IMOGEN 
Well or ill, 

I am bound to you. 
BELARIUS 
And shalt be ever. 
Exit IMOGEN, to the cave 
This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had 
Good ancestors. 
ARVIRAGUS 
How angel-like he sings! 
GUIDERIUS 
But his neat cookery! he cut our roots 
In characters, 
And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick 
And he her dieter. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Nobly he yokes 
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh 
Was that it was, for not being such a smile; 
The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly 
From so divine a temple, to commix 
With winds that sailors rail at. 
GUIDERIUS 
I do note 
That grief and patience, rooted in him both, 
Mingle their spurs together. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Grow, patience! 
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine 

His perishing root with the increasing vine! 
BELARIUS 
It is great morning. Come, away!-- 
Who's there? 
Enter CLOTEN 
CLOTEN 
I cannot find those runagates; that villain 
Hath mock'd me. I am faint. 
BELARIUS 
'Those runagates!' 
Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis 
Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush. 
I saw him not these many years, and yet 
I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence! 
GUIDERIUS 
He is but one: you and my brother search 
What companies are near: pray you, away; 
Let me alone with him. 
Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS 
CLOTEN 
Soft! What are you 
That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers? 
I have heard of such. What slave art thou? 
GUIDERIUS 
A thing 
More slavish did I ne'er than answering 
A slave without a knock. 

CLOTEN 
Thou art a robber, 
A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief. 
GUIDERIUS 
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I 
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big? 
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not 
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art, 
Why I should yield to thee? 
CLOTEN 
Thou villain base, 
Know'st me not by my clothes? 
GUIDERIUS 
No, nor thy tailor, rascal, 
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes, 
Which, as it seems, make thee. 
CLOTEN 
Thou precious varlet, 
My tailor made them not. 
GUIDERIUS 
Hence, then, and thank 
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool; 
I am loath to beat thee. 
CLOTEN 
Thou injurious thief, 
Hear but my name, and tremble. 
GUIDERIUS 

What's thy name? 
CLOTEN 
Cloten, thou villain. 
GUIDERIUS 
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name, 
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or 
Adder, Spider, 
'Twould move me sooner. 
CLOTEN 
To thy further fear, 
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know 
I am son to the queen. 
GUIDERIUS 
I am sorry for 't; not seeming 
So worthy as thy birth. 
CLOTEN 
Art not afeard? 
GUIDERIUS 
Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise: 
At fools I laugh, not fear them. 
CLOTEN 
Die the death: 
When I have slain thee with my proper hand, 
I'll follow those that even now fled hence, 
And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads: 
Yield, rustic mountaineer. 

Exeunt, fighting 
Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS 
BELARIUS 
No companies abroad? 
ARVIRAGUS 
None in the world: you did mistake him, sure. 
BELARIUS 
I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him, 
But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour 
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice, 
And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute 
'Twas very Cloten. 
ARVIRAGUS 
In this place we left them: 
I wish my brother make good time with him, 
You say he is so fell. 
BELARIUS 
Being scarce made up, 
I mean, to man, he had not apprehension 
Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment 
Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother. 
Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head 
GUIDERIUS 
This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse; 
There was no money in't: not Hercules 
Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none: 
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne 

My head as I do his. 
BELARIUS 
What hast thou done? 
GUIDERIUS 
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head, 
Son to the queen, after his own report; 
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore 
With his own single hand he'ld take us in 
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow, 
And set them on Lud's-town. 
BELARIUS 
We are all undone. 
GUIDERIUS 
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose, 
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law 
Protects not us: then why should we be tender 
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us, 
Play judge and executioner all himself, 
For we do fear the law? What company 
Discover you abroad? 
BELARIUS 
No single soul 
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason 
He must have some attendants. Though his humour 
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that 
From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not 
Absolute madness could so far have raved 
To bring him here alone; although perhaps 
It may be heard at court that such as we 
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time 
May make some stronger head; the which he hearing-- 
As it is like him--might break out, and swear 

He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable 
To come alone, either he so undertaking, 
Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear, 
If we do fear this body hath a tail 
More perilous than the head. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Let ordinance 
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er, 
My brother hath done well. 
BELARIUS 
I had no mind 
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness 
Did make my way long forth. 
GUIDERIUS 
With his own sword, 
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en 
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek 
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea, 
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten: 
That's all I reck. 
Exit 
BELARIUS 
I fear 'twill be revenged: 
Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour 
Becomes thee well enough. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Would I had done't 
So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore, 
I love thee brotherly, but envy much 
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges, 
That possible strength might meet, would seek us through 

And put us to our answer. 
BELARIUS 
Well, 'tis done: 
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger 
Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock; 
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay 
Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him 
To dinner presently. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Poor sick Fidele! 
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour 
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood, 
And praise myself for charity. 
Exit 
BELARIUS 
O thou goddess, 
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st 
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle 
As zephyrs blowing below the violet, 
Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough, 
Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind, 
That by the top doth take the mountain pine, 
And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder 
That an invisible instinct should frame them 
To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught, 
Civility not seen from other, valour 
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop 
As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange 
What Cloten's being here to us portends, 
Or what his death will bring us. 
Re-enter GUIDERIUS 
GUIDERIUS 

Where's my brother? 
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream, 
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage 
For his return. 
Solemn music 
BELARIUS 
My ingenious instrument! 
Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion 
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark! 
GUIDERIUS 
Is he at home? 
BELARIUS 
He went hence even now. 
GUIDERIUS 
What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother 
it did not speak before. All solemn things 
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter? 
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys 
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys. 
Is Cadwal mad? 
BELARIUS 
Look, here he comes, 
And brings the dire occasion in his arms 
Of what we blame him for. 
Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms 
ARVIRAGUS 
The bird is dead 

That we have made so much on. I had rather 
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty, 
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch, 
Than have seen this. 
GUIDERIUS 
O sweetest, fairest lily! 
My brother wears thee not the one half so well 
As when thou grew'st thyself. 
BELARIUS 
O melancholy! 
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find 
The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare 
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing! 
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I, 
Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy. 
How found you him? 
ARVIRAGUS 
Stark, as you see: 
Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber, 
Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his 
right cheek 
Reposing on a cushion. 
GUIDERIUS 
Where? 
ARVIRAGUS 
O' the floor; 
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put 
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness 
Answer'd my steps too loud. 
GUIDERIUS 

Why, he but sleeps: 
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed; 
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted, 
And worms will not come to thee. 
ARVIRAGUS 
With fairest flowers 
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele, 
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack 
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor 
The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor 
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, 
Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would, 
With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming 
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie 
Without a monument!--bring thee all this; 
Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none, 
To winter-ground thy corse. 
GUIDERIUS 
Prithee, have done; 
And do not play in wench-like words with that 
Which is so serious. Let us bury him, 
And not protract with admiration what 
Is now due debt. To the grave! 
ARVIRAGUS 
Say, where shall's lay him? 
GUIDERIUS 
By good Euriphile, our mother. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Be't so: 
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices 
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground, 
As once our mother; use like note and words, 

Save that Euriphile must be Fidele. 
GUIDERIUS 
Cadwal, 
I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee; 
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse 
Than priests and fanes that lie. 
ARVIRAGUS 
We'll speak it, then. 
BELARIUS 
Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten 
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys; 
And though he came our enemy, remember 
He was paid for that: though mean and 
mighty, rotting 
Together, have one dust, yet reverence, 
That angel of the world, doth make distinction 
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely 
And though you took his life, as being our foe, 
Yet bury him as a prince. 
GUIDERIUS 
Pray You, fetch him hither. 
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax', 
When neither are alive. 
ARVIRAGUS 
If you'll go fetch him, 
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin. 
Exit BELARIUS 
GUIDERIUS 

Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east; 
My father hath a reason for't. 
ARVIRAGUS 
'Tis true. 
GUIDERIUS 
Come on then, and remove him. 
ARVIRAGUS 
So. Begin. 
SONG 
GUIDERIUS 
Fear no more the heat o' the sun, 
Nor the furious winter's rages; 
Thou thy worldly task hast done, 
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages: 
Golden lads and girls all must, 
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust. 
ARVIRAGUS 
Fear no more the frown o' the great; 
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke; 
Care no more to clothe and eat; 
To thee the reed is as the oak: 
The sceptre, learning, physic, must 
All follow this, and come to dust. 
GUIDERIUS 
Fear no more the lightning flash, 
ARVIRAGUS 

Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone; 
GUIDERIUS 
Fear not slander, censure rash; 
ARVIRAGUS 
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan: 
GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS 
All lovers young, all lovers must 
Consign to thee, and come to dust. 
GUIDERIUS 
No exorciser harm thee! 
ARVIRAGUS 
Nor no witchcraft charm thee! 
GUIDERIUS 
Ghost unlaid forbear thee! 
ARVIRAGUS 
Nothing ill come near thee! 
GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS 
Quiet consummation have; 
And renowned be thy grave! 
Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN 
GUIDERIUS 
We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down. 

BELARIUS 
Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more: 
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night 
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces. 
You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so 
These herblets shall, which we upon you strew. 
Come on, away: apart upon our knees. 
The ground that gave them first has them again: 
Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain. 
Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 
IMOGEN 
[Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is 
the way?-- 
I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither? 
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?-- 
I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep. 
But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses! 
Seeing the body of CLOTEN 
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world; 
This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream; 
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper, 
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so; 
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, 
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes 
Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith, 
I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be 
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity 
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it! 
The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is 
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt. 
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus! 
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand; 
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh; 
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face 
Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio, 

All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, 
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, 
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten, 
Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read 
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio 
Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio-- 
From this most bravest vessel of the world 
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas, 
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me! 
where's that? 
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, 
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio? 
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them 
Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant! 
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious 
And cordial to me, have I not found it 
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home: 
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O! 
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood, 
That we the horrider may seem to those 
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord! 
Falls on the body 
Enter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer 
Captain 
To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia, 
After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending 
You here at Milford-Haven with your ships: 
They are in readiness. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
But what from Rome? 
Captain 
The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners 
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits, 
That promise noble service: and they come 

Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, 
Syenna's brother. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
When expect you them? 
Captain 
With the next benefit o' the wind. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
This forwardness 
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers 
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir, 
What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose? 
Soothsayer 
Last night the very gods show'd me a vision-- 
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus: 
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd 
From the spongy south to this part of the west, 
There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends-- 
Unless my sins abuse my divination-- 
Success to the Roman host. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Dream often so, 
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here 
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime 
It was a worthy building. How! a page! 
Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather; 
For nature doth abhor to make his bed 
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead. 
Let's see the boy's face. 
Captain 
He's alive, my lord. 

CAIUS LUCIUS 
He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one, 
Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems 
They crave to be demanded. Who is this 
Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he 
That, otherwise than noble nature did, 
Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest 
In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it? 
What art thou? 
IMOGEN 
I am nothing: or if not, 
Nothing to be were better. This was my master, 
A very valiant Briton and a good, 
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas! 
There is no more such masters: I may wander 
From east to occident, cry out for service, 
Try many, all good, serve truly, never 
Find such another master. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
'Lack, good youth! 
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than 
Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend. 
IMOGEN 
Richard du Champ. 
Aside 
If I do lie and do 
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope 
They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir? 
CAIUS LUCIUS 

Thy name? 
IMOGEN 
Fidele, sir. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Thou dost approve thyself the very same: 
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name. 
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say 
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure, 
No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters, 
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner 
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me. 
IMOGEN 
I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods, 
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep 
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when 
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave, 
And on it said a century of prayers, 
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh; 
And leaving so his service, follow you, 
So please you entertain me. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Ay, good youth! 
And rather father thee than master thee. 
My friends, 
The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us 
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can, 
And make him with our pikes and partisans 
A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd 
By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd 
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes 
Some falls are means the happier to arise.

SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and Attendants 
CYMBELINE 
Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her. 
Exit an Attendant 
A fever with the absence of her son, 
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens, 
How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen, 
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen 
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time 
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone, 
So needful for this present: it strikes me, past 
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow, 
Who needs must know of her departure and 
Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee 
By a sharp torture. 
PISANIO 
Sir, my life is yours; 
I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress, 
I nothing know where she remains, why gone, 
Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness, 
Hold me your loyal servant. 
First Lord 
Good my liege, 
The day that she was missing he was here: 
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform 
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten, 

There wants no diligence in seeking him, 
And will, no doubt, be found. 
CYMBELINE 
The time is troublesome. 
To PISANIO 
We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy 
Does yet depend. 
First Lord 
So please your majesty, 
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, 
Are landed on your coast, with a supply 
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent. 
CYMBELINE 
Now for the counsel of my son and queen! 
I am amazed with matter. 
First Lord 
Good my liege, 
Your preparation can affront no less 
Than what you hear of: come more, for more 
you're ready: 
The want is but to put those powers in motion 
That long to move. 
CYMBELINE 
I thank you. Let's withdraw; 
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not 
What can from Italy annoy us; but 
We grieve at chances here. Away! 
Exeunt all but PISANIO 

PISANIO 
I heard no letter from my master since 
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange: 
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise 
To yield me often tidings: neither know I 
What is betid to Cloten; but remain 
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work. 
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true. 
These present wars shall find I love my country, 
Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them. 
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd: 
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.

SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius. 
Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS. 
GUIDERIUS 
The noise is round about us. 
BELARIUS 
Let us from it. 
ARVIRAGUS 
What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it 
From action and adventure? 
GUIDERIUS 
Nay, what hope 
Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans 
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us 
For barbarous and unnatural revolts 
During their use, and slay us after. 
BELARIUS 
Sons, 
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us. 
To the king's party there's no going: newness 
Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd 
Among the bands--may drive us to a render 
Where we have lived, and so extort from's that 
Which we have done, whose answer would be death 
Drawn on with torture. 

GUIDERIUS 
This is, sir, a doubt 
In such a time nothing becoming you, 
Nor satisfying us. 
ARVIRAGUS 
It is not likely 
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh, 
Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes 
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now, 
That they will waste their time upon our note, 
To know from whence we are. 
BELARIUS 
O, I am known 
Of many in the army: many years, 
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him 
From my remembrance. And, besides, the king 
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves; 
Who find in my exile the want of breeding, 
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless 
To have the courtesy your cradle promised, 
But to be still hot summer's tamings and 
The shrinking slaves of winter. 
GUIDERIUS 
Than be so 
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army: 
I and my brother are not known; yourself 
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown, 
Cannot be question'd. 
ARVIRAGUS 
By this sun that shines, 
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never 
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood, 
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison! 

Never bestrid a horse, save one that had 
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel 
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed 
To look upon the holy sun, to have 
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining 
So long a poor unknown. 
GUIDERIUS 
By heavens, I'll go: 
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave, 
I'll take the better care, but if you will not, 
The hazard therefore due fall on me by 
The hands of Romans! 
ARVIRAGUS 
So say I amen. 
BELARIUS 
No reason I, since of your lives you set 
So slight a valuation, should reserve 
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys! 
If in your country wars you chance to die, 
That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie: 
Lead, lead. 
Aside 
The time seems long; their blood 
thinks scorn, 
Till it fly out and show them princes born.

SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp. 
Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd 
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones, 
If each of you should take this course, how many 
Must murder wives much better than themselves 
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio! 
Every good servant does not all commands: 
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you 
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never 
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved 
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck 
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack, 
You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love, 
To have them fall no more: you some permit 
To second ills with ills, each elder worse, 
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift. 
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills, 
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither 
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight 
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough 
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace! 
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens, 
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me 
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself 
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight 
Against the part I come with; so I'll die 
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life 
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown, 
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril 
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know 
More valour in me than my habits show. 
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me! 

To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin 
The fashion, less without and more within.

SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps. 
Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman Army: from the other side, the 
British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following, like a poor soldier. They march over 
and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he 
vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him 
IACHIMO 
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom 
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady, 
The princess of this country, and the air on't 
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl, 
A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me 
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne 
As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn. 
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before 
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds 
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods. 
Exit 
The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is taken: then enter, to his rescue, 
BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS 
BELARIUS 
Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground; 
The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but 
The villany of our fears. 
GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS 
Stand, stand, and fight! 
Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, 

and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself; 
For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such 
As war were hoodwink'd. 
IACHIMO 
'Tis their fresh supplies. 
CAIUS LUCIUS 
It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes 
Let's reinforce, or fly. 
Exeunt

Camest thou from where they made the stand?
