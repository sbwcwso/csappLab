s master, the ape his keeper, 
the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin, 

was this directed to you? 
JAQUENETTA 
Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange 
queen's lords. 
HOLOFERNES 
I will overglance the superscript: 'To the 
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady 
Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of 
the letter, for the nomination of the party writing 
to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all 
desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this 
Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here 
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger 
queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of 
progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my 
sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the 
king: it may concern much. Stay not thy 
compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu. 
JAQUENETTA 
Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life! 
COSTARD 
Have with thee, my girl. 
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA 
SIR NATHANIEL 
Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very 
religiously; and, as a certain father saith,-- 
HOLOFERNES 
Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable 

colours. But to return to the verses: did they 
please you, Sir Nathaniel? 
SIR NATHANIEL 
Marvellous well for the pen. 
HOLOFERNES 
I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil 
of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please 
you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my 
privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid 
child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I 
will prove those verses to be very unlearned, 
neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I 
beseech your society. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is 
the happiness of life. 
HOLOFERNES 
And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it. 
To DULL 
Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not 
say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at 
their game, and we will to our recreation.

SCENE III. The same. 
Enter BIRON, with a paper 
BIRON 
The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing 
myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in 
a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul 
word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say 
the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well 
proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as 
Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep: 
well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if 
I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her 
eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not 
love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing 
in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By 
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme 
and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, 
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my 
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent 
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter 
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care 
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one 
with a paper: God give him grace to groan! 
Stands aside 
Enter FERDINAND, with a paper 
FERDINAND 
Ay me! 
BIRON 

[Aside] Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid: 
thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the 
left pap. In faith, secrets! 
FERDINAND 
[Reads] 
So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not 
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose, 
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote 
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows: 
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright 
Through the transparent bosom of the deep, 
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light; 
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep: 
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee; 
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe. 
Do but behold the tears that swell in me, 
And they thy glory through my grief will show: 
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep 
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep. 
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel, 
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell. 
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper: 
Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here? 
Steps aside 
What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear. 
BIRON 
Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear! 
Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper 
LONGAVILLE 
Ay me, I am forsworn! 
BIRON 

Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers. 
FERDINAND 
In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame! 
BIRON 
One drunkard loves another of the name. 
LONGAVILLE 
Am I the first that have been perjured so? 
BIRON 
I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know: 
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society, 
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity. 
LONGAVILLE 
I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move: 
O sweet Maria, empress of my love! 
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose. 
BIRON 
O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose: 
Disfigure not his slop. 
LONGAVILLE 
This same shall go. 
Reads 
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye, 
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument, 
Persuade my heart to this false perjury? 
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment. 

A woman I forswore; but I will prove, 
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee: 
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love; 
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me. 
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is: 
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine, 
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is: 
If broken then, it is no fault of mine: 
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise 
To lose an oath to win a paradise? 
BIRON 
This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity, 
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry. 
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way. 
LONGAVILLE 
By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay. 
Steps aside 
BIRON 
All hid, all hid; an old infant play. 
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky. 
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye. 
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish! 
Enter DUMAIN, with a paper 
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish! 
DUMAIN 
O most divine Kate! 
BIRON 
O most profane coxcomb! 

DUMAIN 
By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye! 
BIRON 
By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie. 
DUMAIN 
Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted. 
BIRON 
An amber-colour'd raven was well noted. 
DUMAIN 
As upright as the cedar. 
BIRON 
Stoop, I say; 
Her shoulder is with child. 
DUMAIN 
As fair as day. 
BIRON 
Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine. 
DUMAIN 
O that I had my wish! 
LONGAVILLE 
And I had mine! 

FERDINAND 
And I mine too, good Lord! 
BIRON 
Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word? 
DUMAIN 
I would forget her; but a fever she 
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be. 
BIRON 
A fever in your blood! why, then incision 
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision! 
DUMAIN 
Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ. 
BIRON 
Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit. 
DUMAIN 
[Reads] 
On a day--alack the day!-- 
Love, whose month is ever May, 
Spied a blossom passing fair 
Playing in the wanton air: 
Through the velvet leaves the wind, 
All unseen, can passage find; 
That the lover, sick to death, 
Wish himself the heaven's breath. 
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow; 
Air, would I might triumph so! 
But, alack, my hand is sworn 
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn; 

Vow, alack, for youth unmeet, 
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet! 
Do not call it sin in me, 
That I am forsworn for thee; 
Thou for whom Jove would swear 
Juno but an Ethiope were; 
And deny himself for Jove, 
Turning mortal for thy love. 
This will I send, and something else more plain, 
That shall express my true love's fasting pain. 
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville, 
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill, 
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note; 
For none offend where all alike do dote. 
LONGAVILLE 
[Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity. 
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know, 
To be o'erheard and taken napping so. 
FERDINAND 
[Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such; 
You chide at him, offending twice as much; 
You do not love Maria; Longaville 
Did never sonnet for her sake compile, 
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart 
His loving bosom to keep down his heart. 
I have been closely shrouded in this bush 
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush: 
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion, 
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion: 
Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries; 
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes: 
To LONGAVILLE 
You would for paradise break faith, and troth; 
To DUMAIN 

And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath. 
What will Biron say when that he shall hear 
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear? 
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit! 
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it! 
For all the wealth that ever I did see, 
I would not have him know so much by me. 
BIRON 
Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy. 
Advancing 
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me! 
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove 
These worms for loving, that art most in love? 
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears 
There is no certain princess that appears; 
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing; 
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting! 
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not, 
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot? 
You found his mote; the king your mote did see; 
But I a beam do find in each of three. 
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen, 
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen! 
O me, with what strict patience have I sat, 
To see a king transformed to a gnat! 
To see great Hercules whipping a gig, 
And profound Solomon to tune a jig, 
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys, 
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys! 
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain? 
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain? 
And where my liege's? all about the breast: 
A caudle, ho! 
FERDINAND 
Too bitter is thy jest. 
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view? 

BIRON 
Not you to me, but I betray'd by you: 
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin 
To break the vow I am engaged in; 
I am betray'd, by keeping company 
With men like men of inconstancy. 
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme? 
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time 
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I 
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye, 
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist, 
A leg, a limb? 
FERDINAND 
Soft! whither away so fast? 
A true man or a thief that gallops so? 
BIRON 
I post from love: good lover, let me go. 
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD 
JAQUENETTA 
God bless the king! 
FERDINAND 
What present hast thou there? 
COSTARD 
Some certain treason. 
FERDINAND 
What makes treason here? 

COSTARD 
Nay, it makes nothing, sir. 
FERDINAND 
If it mar nothing neither, 
The treason and you go in peace away together. 
JAQUENETTA 
I beseech your grace, let this letter be read: 
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said. 
FERDINAND 
Biron, read it over. 
Giving him the paper 
Where hadst thou it? 
JAQUENETTA 
Of Costard. 
FERDINAND 
Where hadst thou it? 
COSTARD 
Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio. 
BIRON tears the letter 
FERDINAND 
How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it? 
BIRON 

A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it. 
LONGAVILLE 
It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it. 
DUMAIN 
It is Biron's writing, and here is his name. 
Gathering up the pieces 
BIRON 
[To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were 
born to do me shame. 
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess. 
FERDINAND 
What? 
BIRON 
That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess: 
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I, 
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die. 
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more. 
DUMAIN 
Now the number is even. 
BIRON 
True, true; we are four. 
Will these turtles be gone? 
FERDINAND 

Hence, sirs; away! 
COSTARD 
Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay. 
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA 
BIRON 
Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace! 
As true we are as flesh and blood can be: 
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face; 
Young blood doth not obey an old decree: 
We cannot cross the cause why we were born; 
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn. 
FERDINAND 
What, did these rent lines show some love of thine? 
BIRON 
Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline, 
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde, 
At the first opening of the gorgeous east, 
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind 
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast? 
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye 
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow, 
That is not blinded by her majesty? 
FERDINAND 
What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now? 
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon; 
She an attending star, scarce seen a light. 
BIRON 
My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron: 

O, but for my love, day would turn to night! 
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty 
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek, 
Where several worthies make one dignity, 
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek. 
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,-- 
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not: 
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs, 
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot. 
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn, 
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye: 
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born, 
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy: 
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine. 
FERDINAND 
By heaven, thy love is black as ebony. 
BIRON 
Is ebony like her? O wood divine! 
A wife of such wood were felicity. 
O, who can give an oath? where is a book? 
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack, 
If that she learn not of her eye to look: 
No face is fair that is not full so black. 
FERDINAND 
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell, 
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night; 
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well. 
BIRON 
Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light. 
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd, 
It mourns that painting and usurping hair 
Should ravish doters with a false aspect; 
And therefore is she born to make black fair. 
Her favour turns the fashion of the days, 

For native blood is counted painting now; 
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise, 
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow. 
DUMAIN 
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black. 
LONGAVILLE 
And since her time are colliers counted bright. 
FERDINAND 
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack. 
DUMAIN 
Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light. 
BIRON 
Your mistresses dare never come in rain, 
For fear their colours should be wash'd away. 
FERDINAND 
'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain, 
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day. 
BIRON 
I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here. 
FERDINAND 
No devil will fright thee then so much as she. 
DUMAIN 
I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear. 

LONGAVILLE 
Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see. 
BIRON 
O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes, 
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread! 
DUMAIN 
O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies 
The street should see as she walk'd overhead. 
FERDINAND 
But what of this? are we not all in love? 
BIRON 
Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn. 
FERDINAND 
Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove 
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn. 
DUMAIN 
Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil. 
LONGAVILLE 
O, some authority how to proceed; 
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil. 
DUMAIN 
Some salve for perjury. 

BIRON 
'Tis more than need. 
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms. 
Consider what you first did swear unto, 
To fast, to study, and to see no woman; 
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. 
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young; 
And abstinence engenders maladies. 
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords, 
In that each of you have forsworn his book, 
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look? 
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you, 
Have found the ground of study's excellence 
Without the beauty of a woman's face? 
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes 
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire 
Why, universal plodding poisons up 
The nimble spirits in the arteries, 
As motion and long-during action tires 
The sinewy vigour of the traveller. 
Now, for not looking on a woman's face, 
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes 
And study too, the causer of your vow; 
For where is any author in the world 
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye? 
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself 
And where we are our learning likewise is: 
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes, 
Do we not likewise see our learning there? 
O, we have made a vow to study, lords, 
And in that vow we have forsworn our books. 
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you, 
In leaden contemplation have found out 
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes 
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with? 
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain; 
And therefore, finding barren practisers, 
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil: 
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes, 
Lives not alone immured in the brain; 

But, with the motion of all elements, 
Courses as swift as thought in every power, 
And gives to every power a double power, 
Above their functions and their offices. 
It adds a precious seeing to the eye; 
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind; 
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound, 
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd: 
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible 
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails; 
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste: 
For valour, is not Love a Hercules, 
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides? 
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical 
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair: 
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods 
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony. 
Never durst poet touch a pen to write 
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs; 
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears 
And plant in tyrants mild humility. 
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: 
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire; 
They are the books, the arts, the academes, 
That show, contain and nourish all the world: 
Else none at all in ought proves excellent. 
Then fools you were these women to forswear, 
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools. 
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love, 
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men, 
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women, 
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men, 
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves, 
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths. 
It is religion to be thus forsworn, 
For charity itself fulfills the law, 
And who can sever love from charity? 
FERDINAND 
Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field! 
BIRON 

Advance your standards, and upon them, lords; 
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised, 
In conflict that you get the sun of them. 
LONGAVILLE 
Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by: 
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France? 
FERDINAND 
And win them too: therefore let us devise 
Some entertainment for them in their tents. 
BIRON 
First, from the park let us conduct them thither; 
Then homeward every man attach the hand 
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon 
We will with some strange pastime solace them, 
Such as the shortness of the time can shape; 
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours 
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers. 
FERDINAND 
Away, away! no time shall be omitted 
That will betime, and may by us be fitted. 
BIRON 
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn; 
And justice always whirls in equal measure: 
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn; 
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

SCENE I. The same. 
Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL 
HOLOFERNES 
Satis quod sufficit. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner 
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without 
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without 
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange without 
heresy. I did converse this quondam day with 
a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nominated, 
or called, Don Adriano de Armado. 
HOLOFERNES 
Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his 
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye 
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general 
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is 
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it 
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
A most singular and choice epithet. 
Draws out his table-book 
HOLOFERNES 
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer 

than the staple of his argument. I abhor such 
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and 
point-devise companions; such rackers of 
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should 
say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d, 
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf; 
half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh 
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he 
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of 
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
Laus Deo, bene intelligo. 
HOLOFERNES 
Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd, 
'twill serve. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
Videsne quis venit? 
HOLOFERNES 
Video, et gaudeo. 
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Chirrah! 
To MOTH 
HOLOFERNES 
Quare chirrah, not sirrah? 

DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Men of peace, well encountered. 
HOLOFERNES 
Most military sir, salutation. 
MOTH 
[Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast 
of languages, and stolen the scraps. 
COSTARD 
O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words. 
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word; 
for thou art not so long by the head as 
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier 
swallowed than a flap-dragon. 
MOTH 
Peace! the peal begins. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
[To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered? 
MOTH 
Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a, 
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head? 
HOLOFERNES 
Ba, pueritia, with a horn added. 

MOTH 
Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning. 
HOLOFERNES 
Quis, quis, thou consonant? 
MOTH 
The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or 
the fifth, if I. 
HOLOFERNES 
I will repeat them,--a, e, i,-- 
MOTH 
The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet 
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and 
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit! 
MOTH 
Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old. 
HOLOFERNES 
What is the figure? what is the figure? 
MOTH 
Horns. 
HOLOFERNES 

Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig. 
MOTH 
Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about 
your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn. 
COSTARD 
An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst 
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very 
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny 
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an 
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my 
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me! 
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers' 
ends, as they say. 
HOLOFERNES 
O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the 
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the 
charge-house on the top of the mountain? 
HOLOFERNES 
Or mons, the hill. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain. 
HOLOFERNES 

I do, sans question. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and 
affection to congratulate the princess at her 
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the 
rude multitude call the afternoon. 
HOLOFERNES 
The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is 
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon: 
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do 
assure you, sir, I do assure. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, 
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is 
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee, 
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy 
head: and among other important and most serious 
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let 
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his 
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor 
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally 
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet 
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no 
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his 
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of 
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass. 
The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do 
implore secrecy,--that the king would have me 
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some 
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or 
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the 
curate and your sweet self are good at such 
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it 
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to 

crave your assistance. 
HOLOFERNES 
Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies. 
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some 
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by 
our assistants, at the king's command, and this most 
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before 
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the 
Nine Worthies. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
Where will you find men worthy enough to present them? 
HOLOFERNES 
Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman, 
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great 
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the 
page, Hercules,-- 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for 
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club. 
HOLOFERNES 
Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in 
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a 
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose. 
MOTH 
An excellent device! so, if any of the audience 
hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou 
crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an 
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it. 
DON 

ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
For the rest of the Worthies?-- 
HOLOFERNES 
I will play three myself. 
MOTH 
Thrice-worthy gentleman! 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Shall I tell you a thing? 
HOLOFERNES 
We attend. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I 
beseech you, follow. 
HOLOFERNES 
Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while. 
DULL 
Nor understood none neither, sir. 
HOLOFERNES 
Allons! we will employ thee. 
DULL 

I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play 
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay. 
HOLOFERNES 
Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!

Previous scene 
SCENE II. The same. 
Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA 
PRINCESS 
Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart, 
If fairings come thus plentifully in: 
A lady wall'd about with diamonds! 
Look you what I have from the loving king. 
ROSALINE 
Madame, came nothing else along with that? 
PRINCESS 
Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme 
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper, 
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all, 
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name. 
ROSALINE 
That was the way to make his godhead wax, 
For he hath been five thousand years a boy. 
KATHARINE 
Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too. 
ROSALINE 
You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister. 
KATHARINE 

He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy; 
And so she died: had she been light, like you, 
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit, 
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died: 
And so may you; for a light heart lives long. 
ROSALINE 
What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word? 
KATHARINE 
A light condition in a beauty dark. 
ROSALINE 
We need more light to find your meaning out. 
KATHARINE 
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff; 
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument. 
ROSALINE 
Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark. 
KATHARINE 
So do not you, for you are a light wench. 
ROSALINE 
Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light. 
KATHARINE 
You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me. 
ROSALINE 

Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.' 
PRINCESS 
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd. 
But Rosaline, you have a favour too: 
Who sent it? and what is it? 
ROSALINE 
I would you knew: 
An if my face were but as fair as yours, 
My favour were as great; be witness this. 
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron: 
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too, 
I were the fairest goddess on the ground: 
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs. 
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter! 
PRINCESS 
Any thing like? 
ROSALINE 
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise. 
PRINCESS 
Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion. 
KATHARINE 
Fair as a text B in a copy-book. 
ROSALINE 
'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor, 
My red dominical, my golden letter: 
O, that your face were not so full of O's! 

KATHARINE 
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows. 
PRINCESS 
But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain? 
KATHARINE 
Madam, this glove. 
PRINCESS 
Did he not send you twain? 
KATHARINE 
Yes, madam, and moreover 
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover, 
A huge translation of hypocrisy, 
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity. 
MARIA 
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville: 
The letter is too long by half a mile. 
PRINCESS 
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart 
The chain were longer and the letter short? 
MARIA 
Ay, or I would these hands might never part. 
PRINCESS 
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so. 

ROSALINE 
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so. 
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go: 
O that I knew he were but in by the week! 
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek 
And wait the season and observe the times 
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes 
And shape his service wholly to my hests 
And make him proud to make me proud that jests! 
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state 
That he should be my fool and I his fate. 
PRINCESS 
None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd, 
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd, 
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school 
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool. 
ROSALINE 
The blood of youth burns not with such excess 
As gravity's revolt to wantonness. 
MARIA 
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note 
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote; 
Since all the power thereof it doth apply 
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity. 
PRINCESS 
Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face. 
Enter BOYET 
BOYET 
O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace? 

PRINCESS 
Thy news Boyet? 
BOYET 
Prepare, madam, prepare! 
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are 
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised, 
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised: 
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence; 
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence. 
PRINCESS 
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they 
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say. 
BOYET 
Under the cool shade of a sycamore 
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour; 
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest, 
Toward that shade I might behold addrest 
The king and his companions: warily 
I stole into a neighbour thicket by, 
And overheard what you shall overhear, 
That, by and by, disguised they will be here. 
Their herald is a pretty knavish page, 
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage: 
Action and accent did they teach him there; 
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:' 
And ever and anon they made a doubt 
Presence majestical would put him out, 
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see; 
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.' 
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil; 
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.' 
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder, 
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder: 
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore 

A better speech was never spoke before; 
Another, with his finger and his thumb, 
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;' 
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;' 
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell. 
With that, they all did tumble on the ground, 
With such a zealous laughter, so profound, 
That in this spleen ridiculous appears, 
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears. 
PRINCESS 
But what, but what, come they to visit us? 
BOYET 
They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus. 
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess. 
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance; 
And every one his love-feat will advance 
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know 
By favours several which they did bestow. 
PRINCESS 
And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd; 
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd; 
And not a man of them shall have the grace, 
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face. 
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear, 
And then the king will court thee for his dear; 
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine, 
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline. 
And change your favours too; so shall your loves 
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes. 
ROSALINE 
Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight. 
KATHARINE 

But in this changing what is your intent? 
PRINCESS 
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs: 
They do it but in mocking merriment; 
And mock for mock is only my intent. 
Their several counsels they unbosom shall 
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal 
Upon the next occasion that we meet, 
With visages displayed, to talk and greet. 
ROSALINE 
But shall we dance, if they desire to't? 
PRINCESS 
No, to the death, we will not move a foot; 
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace, 
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face. 
BOYET 
Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart, 
And quite divorce his memory from his part. 
PRINCESS 
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt 
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out 
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown, 
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own: 
So shall we stay, mocking intended game, 
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame. 
Trumpets sound within 
BOYET 
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come. 

The Ladies mask 
Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and 
DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked 
MOTH 
All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!-- 
BOYET 
Beauties no richer than rich taffeta. 
MOTH 
A holy parcel of the fairest dames. 
The Ladies turn their backs to him 
That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views! 
BIRON 
[Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes! 
MOTH 
That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out-- 
BOYET 
True; out indeed. 
MOTH 
Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe 
Not to behold-- 
BIRON 

[Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue. 
MOTH 
Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes, 
--with your sun-beamed eyes-- 
BOYET 
They will not answer to that epithet; 
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.' 
MOTH 
They do not mark me, and that brings me out. 
BIRON 
Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue! 
Exit MOTH 
ROSALINE 
What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet: 
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will: 
That some plain man recount their purposes 
Know what they would. 
BOYET 
What would you with the princess? 
BIRON 
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. 
ROSALINE 
What would they, say they? 

BOYET 
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. 
ROSALINE 
Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone. 
BOYET 
She says, you have it, and you may be gone. 
FERDINAND 
Say to her, we have measured many miles 
To tread a measure with her on this grass. 
BOYET 
They say, that they have measured many a mile 
To tread a measure with you on this grass. 
ROSALINE 
It is not so. Ask them how many inches 
Is in one mile: if they have measured many, 
The measure then of one is easily told. 
BOYET 
If to come hither you have measured miles, 
And many miles, the princess bids you tell 
How many inches doth fill up one mile. 
BIRON 
Tell her, we measure them by weary steps. 
BOYET 
She hears herself. 

ROSALINE 
How many weary steps, 
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone, 
Are number'd in the travel of one mile? 
BIRON 
We number nothing that we spend for you: 
Our duty is so rich, so infinite, 
That we may do it still without accompt. 
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face, 
That we, like savages, may worship it. 
ROSALINE 
My face is but a moon, and clouded too. 
FERDINAND 
Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do! 
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine, 
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne. 
ROSALINE 
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter; 
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water. 
FERDINAND 
Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change. 
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange. 
ROSALINE 
Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon. 
Music plays 

Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon. 
FERDINAND 
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged? 
ROSALINE 
You took the moon at full, but now she's changed. 
FERDINAND 
Yet still she is the moon, and I the man. 
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it. 
ROSALINE 
Our ears vouchsafe it. 
FERDINAND 
But your legs should do it. 
ROSALINE 
Since you are strangers and come here by chance, 
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance. 
FERDINAND 
Why take we hands, then? 
ROSALINE 
Only to part friends: 
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends. 
FERDINAND 
More measure of this measure; be not nice. 

ROSALINE 
We can afford no more at such a price. 
FERDINAND 
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company? 
ROSALINE 
Your absence only. 
FERDINAND 
That can never be. 
ROSALINE 
Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu; 
Twice to your visor, and half once to you. 
FERDINAND 
If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat. 
ROSALINE 
In private, then. 
FERDINAND 
I am best pleased with that. 
They converse apart 
BIRON 
White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee. 
PRINCESS 

Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three. 
BIRON 
Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice, 
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice! 
There's half-a-dozen sweets. 
PRINCESS 
Seventh sweet, adieu: 
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you. 
BIRON 
One word in secret. 
PRINCESS 
Let it not be sweet. 
BIRON 
Thou grievest my gall. 
PRINCESS 
Gall! bitter. 
BIRON 
Therefore meet. 
They converse apart 
DUMAIN 
Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word? 
MARIA 

Name it. 
DUMAIN 
Fair lady,-- 
MARIA 
Say you so? Fair lord,-- 
Take that for your fair lady. 
DUMAIN 
Please it you, 
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu. 
They converse apart 
KATHARINE 
What, was your vizard made without a tongue? 
LONGAVILLE 
I know the reason, lady, why you ask. 
KATHARINE 
O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long. 
LONGAVILLE 
You have a double tongue within your mask, 
And would afford my speechless vizard half. 
KATHARINE 
Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf? 
LONGAVILLE 

A calf, fair lady! 
KATHARINE 
No, a fair lord calf. 
LONGAVILLE 
Let's part the word. 
KATHARINE 
No, I'll not be your half 
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox. 
LONGAVILLE 
Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks! 
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so. 
KATHARINE 
Then die a calf, before your horns do grow. 
LONGAVILLE 
One word in private with you, ere I die. 
KATHARINE 
Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry. 
They converse apart 
BOYET 
The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen 
As is the razor's edge invisible, 
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen, 
Above the sense of sense; so sensible 
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings 

Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things. 
ROSALINE 
Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off. 
BIRON 
By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff! 
FERDINAND 
Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits. 
PRINCESS 
Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits. 
Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors 
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at? 
BOYET 
Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out. 
ROSALINE 
Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat. 
PRINCESS 
O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout! 
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight? 
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces? 
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite. 
ROSALINE 
O, they were all in lamentable cases! 
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word. 

PRINCESS 
Biron did swear himself out of all suit. 
MARIA 
Dumain was at my service, and his sword: 
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute. 
KATHARINE 
Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart; 
And trow you what he called me? 
PRINCESS 
Qualm, perhaps. 
KATHARINE 
Yes, in good faith. 
PRINCESS 
Go, sickness as thou art! 
ROSALINE 
Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps. 
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn. 
PRINCESS 
And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me. 
KATHARINE 
And Longaville was for my service born. 
MARIA 

Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree. 
BOYET 
Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear: 
Immediately they will again be here 
In their own shapes; for it can never be 
They will digest this harsh indignity. 
PRINCESS 
Will they return? 
BOYET 
They will, they will, God knows, 
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows: 
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair, 
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air. 
PRINCESS 
How blow? how blow? speak to be understood. 
BOYET 
Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud; 
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown, 
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown. 
PRINCESS 
Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do, 
If they return in their own shapes to woo? 
ROSALINE 
Good madam, if by me you'll be advised, 
Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised: 
Let us complain to them what fools were here, 

Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear; 
And wonder what they were and to what end 
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd 
And their rough carriage so ridiculous, 
Should be presented at our tent to us. 
BOYET 
Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand. 
PRINCESS 
Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land. 
Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA 
Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits 
FERDINAND 
Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess? 
BOYET 
Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty 
Command me any service to her thither? 
FERDINAND 
That she vouchsafe me audience for one word. 
BOYET 
I will; and so will she, I know, my lord. 
Exit 
BIRON 
This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease, 
And utters it again when God doth please: 

He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares 
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs; 
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know, 
Have not the grace to grace it with such show. 
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve; 
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve; 
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he 
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy; 
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice, 
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice 
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing 
A mean most meanly; and in ushering 
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet; 
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet: 
This is the flower that smiles on every one, 
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone; 
And consciences, that will not die in debt, 
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet. 
FERDINAND 
A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart, 
That put Armado's page out of his part! 
BIRON 
See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou 
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now? 
Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE 
FERDINAND 
All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day! 
PRINCESS 
'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive. 
FERDINAND 
Construe my speeches better, if you may. 

PRINCESS 
Then wish me better; I will give you leave. 
FERDINAND 
We came to visit you, and purpose now 
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then. 
PRINCESS 
This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow: 
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men. 
FERDINAND 
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke: 
The virtue of your eye must break my oath. 
PRINCESS 
You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke; 
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth. 
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure 
As the unsullied lily, I protest, 
A world of torments though I should endure, 
I would not yield to be your house's guest; 
So much I hate a breaking cause to be 
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity. 
FERDINAND 
O, you have lived in desolation here, 
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame. 
PRINCESS 
Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear; 
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game: 
A mess of Russians left us but of late. 

FERDINAND 
How, madam! Russians! 
PRINCESS 
Ay, in truth, my lord; 
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state. 
ROSALINE 
Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord: 
My lady, to the manner of the days, 
In courtesy gives undeserving praise. 
We four indeed confronted were with four 
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour, 
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord, 
They did not bless us with one happy word. 
I dare not call them fools; but this I think, 
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink. 
BIRON 
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet, 
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet, 
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye, 
By light we lose light: your capacity 
Is of that nature that to your huge store 
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor. 
ROSALINE 
This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,-- 
BIRON 
I am a fool, and full of poverty. 
ROSALINE 
But that you take what doth to you belong, 

It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue. 
BIRON 
O, I am yours, and all that I possess! 
ROSALINE 
All the fool mine? 
BIRON 
I cannot give you less. 
ROSALINE 
Which of the vizards was it that you wore? 
BIRON 
Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this? 
ROSALINE 
There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case 
That hid the worse and show'd the better face. 
FERDINAND 
We are descried; they'll mock us now downright. 
DUMAIN 
Let us confess and turn it to a jest. 
PRINCESS 
Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad? 
ROSALINE 

Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale? 
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy. 
BIRON 
Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury. 
Can any face of brass hold longer out? 
Here stand I 
lady, dart thy skill at me; 
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout; 
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance; 
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit; 
And I will wish thee never more to dance, 
Nor never more in Russian habit wait. 
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd, 
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue, 
Nor never come in vizard to my friend, 
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song! 
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise, 
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation, 
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies 
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation: 
I do forswear them; and I here protest, 
By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!-- 
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd 
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes: 
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!-- 
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw. 
ROSALINE 
Sans sans, I pray you. 
BIRON 
Yet I have a trick 
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick; 
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see: 
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three; 
They are infected; in their hearts it lies; 

They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes; 
These lords are visited; you are not free, 
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see. 
PRINCESS 
No, they are free that gave these tokens to us. 
BIRON 
Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us. 
ROSALINE 
It is not so; for how can this be true, 
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue? 
BIRON 
Peace! for I will not have to do with you. 
ROSALINE 
Nor shall not, if I do as I intend. 
BIRON 
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end. 
FERDINAND 
Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression 
Some fair excuse. 
PRINCESS 
The fairest is confession. 
Were not you here but even now disguised? 
FERDINAND 

Madam, I was. 
PRINCESS 
And were you well advised? 
FERDINAND 
I was, fair madam. 
PRINCESS 
When you then were here, 
What did you whisper in your lady's ear? 
FERDINAND 
That more than all the world I did respect her. 
PRINCESS 
When she shall challenge this, you will reject her. 
FERDINAND 
Upon mine honour, no. 
PRINCESS 
Peace, peace! forbear: 
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear. 
FERDINAND 
Despise me, when I break this oath of mine. 
PRINCESS 
I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline, 
What did the Russian whisper in your ear? 

ROSALINE 
Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear 
As precious eyesight, and did value me 
Above this world; adding thereto moreover 
That he would wed me, or else die my lover. 
PRINCESS 
God give thee joy of him! the noble lord 
Most honourably doth unhold his word. 
FERDINAND 
What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth, 
I never swore this lady such an oath. 
ROSALINE 
By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain, 
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again. 
FERDINAND 
My faith and this the princess I did give: 
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve. 
PRINCESS 
Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear; 
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear. 
What, will you have me, or your pearl again? 
BIRON 
Neither of either; I remit both twain. 
I see the trick on't: here was a consent, 
Knowing aforehand of our merriment, 
To dash it like a Christmas comedy: 
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany, 
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick, 

That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick 
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed, 
Told our intents before; which once disclosed, 
The ladies did change favours: and then we, 
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she. 
Now, to our perjury to add more terror, 
We are again forsworn, in will and error. 
Much upon this it is: and might not you 
To BOYET 
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue? 
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier, 
And laugh upon the apple of her eye? 
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire, 
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily? 
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd; 
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud. 
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye 
Wounds like a leaden sword. 
BOYET 
Full merrily 
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run. 
BIRON 
Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done. 
Enter COSTARD 
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray. 
COSTARD 
O Lord, sir, they would know 
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no. 
BIRON 
What, are there but three? 

COSTARD 
No, sir; but it is vara fine, 
For every one pursents three. 
BIRON 
And three times thrice is nine. 
COSTARD 
Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so. 
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know 
what we know: 
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,-- 
BIRON 
Is not nine. 
COSTARD 
Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount. 
BIRON 
By Jove, I always took three threes for nine. 
COSTARD 
O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living 
by reckoning, sir. 
BIRON 
How much is it? 
COSTARD 
O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, 

sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine 
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man 
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir. 
BIRON 
Art thou one of the Worthies? 
COSTARD 
It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the 
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of 
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him. 
BIRON 
Go, bid them prepare. 
COSTARD 
We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take 
some care. 
Exit 
FERDINAND 
Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach. 
BIRON 
We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy 
To have one show worse than the king's and his company. 
FERDINAND 
I say they shall not come. 
PRINCESS 
Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now: 

That sport best pleases that doth least know how: 
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents 
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents: 
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth, 
When great things labouring perish in their birth. 
BIRON 
A right description of our sport, my lord. 
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal 
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words. 
Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper 
PRINCESS 
Doth this man serve God? 
BIRON 
Why ask you? 
PRINCESS 
He speaks not like a man of God's making. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, 
I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding 
fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we 
will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra. 
I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement! 

Exit 
FERDINAND 
Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He 
presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the 
Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page, 
Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if 
these four Worthies in their first show thrive, 
These four will change habits, and present the other five. 
BIRON 
There is five in the first show. 
FERDINAND 
You are deceived; 'tis not so. 
BIRON 
The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool 
and the boy:-- 
Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again 
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein. 
FERDINAND 
The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain. 
Enter COSTARD, for Pompey 
COSTARD 
I Pompey am,-- 
BOYET 
You lie, you are not he. 

COSTARD 
I Pompey am,-- 
BOYET 
With libbard's head on knee. 
BIRON 
Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends 
with thee. 
COSTARD 
I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big-- 
DUMAIN 
The Great. 
COSTARD 
It is, 'Great,' sir:-- 
Pompey surnamed the Great; 
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make 
my foe to sweat: 
And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance, 
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France, 
If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done. 
PRINCESS 
Great thanks, great Pompey. 
COSTARD 
'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I 
made a little fault in 'Great.' 
BIRON 

My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy. 
Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander 
SIR NATHANIEL 
When in the world I lived, I was the world's 
commander; 
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my 
conquering might: 
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,-- 
BOYET 
Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right. 
BIRON 
Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight. 
PRINCESS 
The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander. 
SIR NATHANIEL 
When in the world I lived, I was the world's 
commander,-- 
BOYET 
Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander. 
BIRON 
Pompey the Great,-- 
COSTARD 
Your servant, and Costard. 

BIRON 
Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander. 
COSTARD 
[To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown 
Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of 
the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds 
his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given 
to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror, 
and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander. 
SIR NATHANIEL retires 
There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an 
honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a 
marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good 
bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how 
'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies 
a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort. 
Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules 
HOLOFERNES 
Great Hercules is presented by this imp, 
Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis; 
And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp, 
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus. 
Quoniam he seemeth in minority, 
Ergo I come with this apology. 
Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish. 
MOTH retires 
Judas I am,-- 
DUMAIN 
A Judas! 

HOLOFERNES 
Not Iscariot, sir. 
Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus. 
DUMAIN 
Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas. 
BIRON 
A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas? 
HOLOFERNES 
Judas I am,-- 
DUMAIN 
The more shame for you, Judas. 
HOLOFERNES 
What mean you, sir? 
BOYET 
To make Judas hang himself. 
HOLOFERNES 
Begin, sir; you are my elder. 
BIRON 
Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder. 
HOLOFERNES 
I will not be put out of countenance. 

BIRON 
Because thou hast no face. 
HOLOFERNES 
What is this? 
BOYET 
A cittern-head. 
DUMAIN 
The head of a bodkin. 
BIRON 
A Death's face in a ring. 
LONGAVILLE 
The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen. 
BOYET 
The pommel of Caesar's falchion. 
DUMAIN 
The carved-bone face on a flask. 
BIRON 
Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch. 
DUMAIN 
Ay, and in a brooch of lead. 

BIRON 
Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. 
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance. 
HOLOFERNES 
You have put me out of countenance. 
BIRON 
False; we have given thee faces. 
HOLOFERNES 
But you have out-faced them all. 
BIRON 
An thou wert a lion, we would do so. 
BOYET 
Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go. 
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay? 
DUMAIN 
For the latter end of his name. 
BIRON 
For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away! 
HOLOFERNES 
This is not generous, not gentle, not humble. 
BOYET 

A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble. 
HOLOFERNES retires 
PRINCESS 
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited! 
Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector 
BIRON 
Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms. 
DUMAIN 
Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry. 
FERDINAND 
Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this. 
BOYET 
But is this Hector? 
FERDINAND 
I think Hector was not so clean-timbered. 
LONGAVILLE 
His leg is too big for Hector's. 
DUMAIN 
More calf, certain. 
BOYET 
No; he is best endued in the small. 

BIRON 
This cannot be Hector. 
DUMAIN 
He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, 
Gave Hector a gift,-- 
DUMAIN 
A gilt nutmeg. 
BIRON 
A lemon. 
LONGAVILLE 
Stuck with cloves. 
DUMAIN 
No, cloven. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Peace!-- 
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty 
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion; 
A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea 
From morn till night, out of his pavilion. 
I am that flower,-- 

DUMAIN 
That mint. 
LONGAVILLE 
That columbine. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue. 
LONGAVILLE 
I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector. 
DUMAIN 
Ay, and Hector's a greyhound. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, 
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed, 
he was a man. But I will forward with my device. 
To the PRINCESS 
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing. 
PRINCESS 
Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper. 

BOYET 
[Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,-- 
DUMAIN 
[Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,-- 
COSTARD 
The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she 
is two months on her way. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
What meanest thou? 
COSTARD 
Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor 
wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in 
her belly already: tis yours. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt 
die. 
COSTARD 
Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is 
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by 
him. 

DUMAIN 
Most rare Pompey! 
BOYET 
Renowned Pompey! 
BIRON 
Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey! 
Pompey the Huge! 
DUMAIN 
Hector trembles. 
BIRON 
Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them 
on! stir them on! 
DUMAIN 
Hector will challenge him. 
BIRON 
Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will 
sup a flea. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
By the north pole, I do challenge thee. 
COSTARD 
I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man: 
I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you, 
let me borrow my arms again. 

DUMAIN 
Room for the incensed Worthies! 
COSTARD 
I'll do it in my shirt. 
DUMAIN 
Most resolute Pompey! 
MOTH 
Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you 
not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean 
you? You will lose your reputation. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat 
in my shirt. 
DUMAIN 
You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sweet bloods, I both may and will. 
BIRON 
What reason have you for't? 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 

The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go 
woolward for penance. 
BOYET 
True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of 
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but 
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next 
his heart for a favour. 
Enter MERCADE 
MERCADE 
God save you, madam! 
PRINCESS 
Welcome, Mercade; 
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment. 
MERCADE 
I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring 
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father-- 
PRINCESS 
Dead, for my life! 
MERCADE 
Even so; my tale is told. 
BIRON 
Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 

For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have 
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of 
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier. 
Exeunt Worthies 
FERDINAND 
How fares your majesty? 
PRINCESS 
Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight. 
FERDINAND 
Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay. 
PRINCESS 
Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords, 
For all your fair endeavors; and entreat, 
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe 
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide 
The liberal opposition of our spirits, 
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves 
In the converse of breath: your gentleness 
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord! 
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue: 
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks 
For my great suit so easily obtain'd. 
FERDINAND 
The extreme parts of time extremely forms 
All causes to the purpose of his speed, 
And often at his very loose decides 
That which long process could not arbitrate: 
And though the mourning brow of progeny 
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love 
The holy suit which fain it would convince, 
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot, 

Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it 
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost 
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable 
As to rejoice at friends but newly found. 
PRINCESS 
I understand you not: my griefs are double. 
BIRON 
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief; 
And by these badges understand the king. 
For your fair sakes have we neglected time, 
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies, 
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours 
Even to the opposed end of our intents: 
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,-- 
As love is full of unbefitting strains, 
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain, 
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye, 
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms, 
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll 
To every varied object in his glance: 
Which parti-coated presence of loose love 
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes, 
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities, 
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults, 
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies, 
Our love being yours, the error that love makes 
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false, 
By being once false for ever to be true 
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you: 
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin, 
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace. 
PRINCESS 
We have received your letters full of love; 
Your favours, the ambassadors of love; 
And, in our maiden council, rated them 
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy, 

As bombast and as lining to the time: 
But more devout than this in our respects 
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves 
In their own fashion, like a merriment. 
DUMAIN 
Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest. 
LONGAVILLE 
So did our looks. 
ROSALINE 
We did not quote them so. 
FERDINAND 
Now, at the latest minute of the hour, 
Grant us your loves. 
PRINCESS 
A time, methinks, too short 
To make a world-without-end bargain in. 
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much, 
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this: 
If for my love, as there is no such cause, 
You will do aught, this shall you do for me: 
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed 
To some forlorn and naked hermitage, 
Remote from all the pleasures of the world; 
There stay until the twelve celestial signs 
Have brought about the annual reckoning. 
If this austere insociable life 
Change not your offer made in heat of blood; 
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds 
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love, 
But that it bear this trial and last love; 
Then, at the expiration of the year, 
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts, 

And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine 
I will be thine; and till that instant shut 
My woeful self up in a mourning house, 
Raining the tears of lamentation 
For the remembrance of my father's death. 
If this thou do deny, let our hands part, 
Neither entitled in the other's heart. 
FERDINAND 
If this, or more than this, I would deny, 
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest, 
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye! 
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast. 
DUMAIN 
But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife? 
KATHARINE 
A beard, fair health, and honesty; 
With three-fold love I wish you all these three. 
DUMAIN 
O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife? 
KATHARINE 
Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day 
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say: 
Come when the king doth to my lady come; 
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some. 
DUMAIN 
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then. 
KATHARINE 

Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again. 
LONGAVILLE 
What says Maria? 
MARIA 
At the twelvemonth's end 
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend. 
LONGAVILLE 
I'll stay with patience; but the time is long. 
MARIA 
The liker you; few taller are so young. 
BIRON 
Studies my lady? mistress, look on me; 
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye, 
What humble suit attends thy answer there: 
Impose some service on me for thy love. 
ROSALINE 
Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron, 
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue 
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks, 
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts, 
Which you on all estates will execute 
That lie within the mercy of your wit. 
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain, 
And therewithal to win me, if you please, 
Without the which I am not to be won, 
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day 
Visit the speechless sick and still converse 
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be, 
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit 
To enforce the pained impotent to smile. 

BIRON 
To move wild laughter in the throat of death? 
It cannot be; it is impossible: 
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony. 
ROSALINE 
Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit, 
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace 
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools: 
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear 
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue 
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears, 
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans, 
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then, 
And I will have you and that fault withal; 
But if they will not, throw away that spirit, 
And I shall find you empty of that fault, 
Right joyful of your reformation. 
BIRON 
A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall, 
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital. 
PRINCESS 
[To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave. 
FERDINAND 
No, madam; we will bring you on your way. 
BIRON 
Our wooing doth not end like an old play; 
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy 
Might well have made our sport a comedy. 

FERDINAND 
Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day, 
And then 'twill end. 
BIRON 
That's too long for a play. 
Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,-- 
PRINCESS 
Was not that Hector? 
DUMAIN 
The worthy knight of Troy. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am 
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the 
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most 
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that 
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the 
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the 
end of our show. 
FERDINAND 
Call them forth quickly; we will do so. 
DON 

ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
Holla! approach. 
Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and others 
This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring; 
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the 
cuckoo. Ver, begin. 
THE SONG 
SPRING. 
When daisies pied and violets blue 
And lady-smocks all silver-white 
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue 
Do paint the meadows with delight, 
The cuckoo then, on every tree, 
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo; 
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear, 
Unpleasing to a married ear! 
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws 
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks, 
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws, 
And maidens bleach their summer smocks 
The cuckoo then, on every tree, 
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo; 
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear, 
Unpleasing to a married ear! 
WINTER. 
When icicles hang by the wall 
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail 
And Tom bears logs into the hall 
And milk comes frozen home in pail, 
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul, 
Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; 
Tu-who, a merry note, 
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. 
When all aloud the wind doth blow 
And coughing drowns the parson's saw 
And birds sit brooding in the snow 
And Marian's nose looks red and raw, 

When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, 
Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; 
Tu-who, a merry note, 
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. 
DON 
ADRIANO DE ARMADO 
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of 
Apollo. You that way: we this way.

SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace. 
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
Escalus. 
ESCALUS 
My lord. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
Of government the properties to unfold, 
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse; 
Since I am put to know that your own science 
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice 
My strength can give you: then no more remains, 
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able, 
And let them work. The nature of our people, 
Our city's institutions, and the terms 
For common justice, you're as pregnant in 
As art and practise hath enriched any 
That we remember. There is our commission, 
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither, 
I say, bid come before us Angelo. 
Exit an Attendant 
What figure of us think you he will bear? 
For you must know, we have with special soul 
Elected him our absence to supply, 
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love, 
And given his deputation all the organs 
Of our own power: what think you of it? 

ESCALUS 
If any in Vienna be of worth 
To undergo such ample grace and honour, 
It is Lord Angelo. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
Look where he comes. 
Enter ANGELO 
ANGELO 
Always obedient to your grace's will, 
I come to know your pleasure. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
Angelo, 
There is a kind of character in thy life, 
That to the observer doth thy history 
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings 
Are not thine own so proper as to waste 
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. 
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, 
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues 
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike 
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd 
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends 
The smallest scruple of her excellence 
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines 
Herself the glory of a creditor, 
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech 
To one that can my part in him advertise; 
Hold therefore, Angelo:-- 
In our remove be thou at full ourself; 
Mortality and mercy in Vienna 
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus, 
Though first in question, is thy secondary. 
Take thy commission. 

ANGELO 
Now, good my lord, 
Let there be some more test made of my metal, 
Before so noble and so great a figure 
Be stamp'd upon it. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
No more evasion: 
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice 
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours. 
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition 
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd 
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you, 
As time and our concernings shall importune, 
How it goes with us, and do look to know 
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well; 
To the hopeful execution do I leave you 
Of your commissions. 
ANGELO 
Yet give leave, my lord, 
That we may bring you something on the way. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
My haste may not admit it; 
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do 
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own 
So to enforce or qualify the laws 
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand: 
I'll privily away. I love the people, 
But do not like to stage me to their eyes: 
Through it do well, I do not relish well 
Their loud applause and Aves vehement; 
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion 
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well. 
ANGELO 

The heavens give safety to your purposes! 
ESCALUS 
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness! 
DUKE 
I thank you. Fare you well. 
Exit 
ESCALUS 
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave 
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me 
To look into the bottom of my place: 
A power I have, but of what strength and nature 
I am not yet instructed. 
ANGELO 
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together, 
And we may soon our satisfaction have 
Touching that point. 
ESCALUS 
I'll wait upon your honour.

SCENE II. A Street. 
Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen 
LUCIO 
If the duke with the other dukes come not to 
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all 
the dukes fall upon the king. 
First Gentleman 
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of 
Hungary's! 
Second Gentleman 
Amen. 
LUCIO 
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that 
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped 
one out of the table. 
Second Gentleman 
'Thou shalt not steal'? 
LUCIO 
Ay, that he razed. 
First Gentleman 

Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and 
all the rest from their functions: they put forth 
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in 
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition 
well that prays for peace. 
Second Gentleman 
I never heard any soldier dislike it. 
LUCIO 
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where 
grace was said. 
Second Gentleman 
No? a dozen times at least. 
First Gentleman 
What, in metre? 
LUCIO 
In any proportion or in any language. 
First Gentleman 
I think, or in any religion. 
LUCIO 
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all 
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a 
wicked villain, despite of all grace. 
First Gentleman 
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us. 

LUCIO 
I grant; as there may between the lists and the 
velvet. Thou art the list. 
First Gentleman 
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt 
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief 
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou 
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak 
feelingly now? 
LUCIO 
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful 
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own 
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I 
live, forget to drink after thee. 
First Gentleman 
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not? 
Second Gentleman 
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free. 
LUCIO 
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I 
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to-- 
Second Gentleman 
To what, I pray? 
LUCIO 
Judge. 

Second Gentleman 
To three thousand dolours a year. 
First Gentleman 
Ay, and more. 
LUCIO 
A French crown more. 
First Gentleman 
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou 
art full of error; I am sound. 
LUCIO 
Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as 
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; 
impiety has made a feast of thee. 
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE 
First Gentleman 
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica? 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried 
to prison was worth five thousand of you all. 
Second Gentleman 
Who's that, I pray thee? 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio. 

First Gentleman 
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw 
him carried away; and, which is more, within these 
three days his head to be chopped off. 
LUCIO 
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. 
Art thou sure of this? 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam 
Julietta with child. 
LUCIO 
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two 
hours since, and he was ever precise in 
promise-keeping. 
Second Gentleman 
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the 
speech we had to such a purpose. 
First Gentleman 
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation. 
LUCIO 
Away! let's go learn the truth of it. 
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen 

MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what 
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am 
custom-shrunk. 
Enter POMPEY 
How now! what's the news with you? 
POMPEY 
Yonder man is carried to prison. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Well; what has he done? 
POMPEY 
A woman. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
But what's his offence? 
POMPEY 
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
What, is there a maid with child by him? 
POMPEY 
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have 
not heard of the proclamation, have you? 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 

What proclamation, man? 
POMPEY 
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
And what shall become of those in the city? 
POMPEY 
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, 
but that a wise burgher put in for them. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be 
pulled down? 
POMPEY 
To the ground, mistress. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth! 
What shall become of me? 
POMPEY 
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no 
clients: though you change your place, you need not 
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. 
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that 
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you 
will be considered. 
MISTRESS OVERDONE 

What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw. 
POMPEY 
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to 
prison; and there's Madam Juliet. 
Exeunt 
Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers 
CLAUDIO 
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world? 
Bear me to prison, where I am committed. 
Provost 
I do it not in evil disposition, 
But from Lord Angelo by special charge. 
CLAUDIO 
Thus can the demigod Authority 
Make us pay down for our offence by weight 
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will; 
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just. 
Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen 
LUCIO 
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint? 
CLAUDIO 
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty: 
As surfeit is the father of much fast, 
So every scope by the immoderate use 
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, 
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, 

A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. 
LUCIO 
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would 
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say 
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom 
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy 
offence, Claudio? 
CLAUDIO 
What but to speak of would offend again. 
LUCIO 
What, is't murder? 
CLAUDIO 
No. 
LUCIO 
Lechery? 
CLAUDIO 
Call it so. 
Provost 
Away, sir! you must go. 
CLAUDIO 
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you. 
LUCIO 
A hundred, if they'll do you any good. 

Is lechery so look'd after? 
CLAUDIO 
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract 
I got possession of Julietta's bed: 
You know the lady; she is fast my wife, 
Save that we do the denunciation lack 
Of outward order: this we came not to, 
Only for propagation of a dower 
Remaining in the coffer of her friends, 
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love 
Till time had made them for us. But it chances 
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment 
With character too gross is writ on Juliet. 
LUCIO 
With child, perhaps? 
CLAUDIO 
Unhappily, even so. 
And the new deputy now for the duke-- 
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, 
Or whether that the body public be 
A horse whereon the governor doth ride, 
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know 
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur; 
Whether the tyranny be in his place, 
Or in his emmence that fills it up, 
I stagger in:--but this new governor 
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties 
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall 
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round 
And none of them been worn; and, for a name, 
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act 
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name. 
LUCIO 
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on 

thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, 
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to 
him. 
CLAUDIO 
I have done so, but he's not to be found. 
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service: 
This day my sister should the cloister enter 
And there receive her approbation: 
Acquaint her with the danger of my state: 
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends 
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him: 
I have great hope in that; for in her youth 
There is a prone and speechless dialect, 
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art 
When she will play with reason and discourse, 
And well she can persuade. 
LUCIO 
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the 
like, which else would stand under grievous 
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I 
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a 
game of tick-tack. I'll to her. 
CLAUDIO 
I thank you, good friend Lucio. 
LUCIO 
Within two hours. 
CLAUDIO 
Come, officer, away!

SCENE III. A monastery. 
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
No, holy father; throw away that thought; 
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love 
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee 
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose 
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends 
Of burning youth. 
FRIAR THOMAS 
May your grace speak of it? 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
My holy sir, none better knows than you 
How I have ever loved the life removed 
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies 
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. 
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo, 
A man of stricture and firm abstinence, 
My absolute power and place here in Vienna, 
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland; 
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear, 
And so it is received. Now, pious sir, 
You will demand of me why I do this? 
FRIAR THOMAS 
Gladly, my lord. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 

We have strict statutes and most biting laws. 
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, 
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip; 
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, 
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, 
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, 
Only to stick it in their children's sight 
For terror, not to use, in time the rod 
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, 
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; 
And liberty plucks justice by the nose; 
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart 
Goes all decorum. 
FRIAR THOMAS 
It rested in your grace 
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased: 
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd 
Than in Lord Angelo. 
DUKE VINCENTIO 
I do fear, too dreadful: 
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, 
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them 
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done, 
When evil deeds have their permissive pass 
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father, 
I have on Angelo imposed the office; 
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home, 
And yet my nature never in the fight 
To do in slander. And to behold his sway, 
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order, 
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee, 
Supply me with the habit and instruct me 
How I may formally in person bear me 
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action 
At our more leisure shall I render you; 
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise; 
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses 
That his blood flows, or that his appetite 

Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see, 
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

SCENE IV. A nunnery. 
Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA 
ISABELLA 
And have you nuns no farther privileges? 
FRANCISCA 
Are not these large enough? 
ISABELLA 
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more; 
But rather wishing a more strict restraint 
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare. 
LUCIO 
[Within] Ho! Peace be in this place! 
ISABELLA 
Who's that which calls? 
FRANCISCA 
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella, 
Turn you the key, and know his business of him; 
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn. 
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men 
But in the presence of the prioress: 
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face, 
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak. 
He calls again; I pray you, answer him. 

Exit 
ISABELLA 
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls 
Enter LUCIO 
LUCIO 
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses 
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me 
As bring me to the sight of Isabella, 
A novice of this place and the fair sister 
To her unhappy brother Claudio? 
ISABELLA 
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask, 
The rather for I now must make you know 
I am that Isabella and his sister. 
LUCIO 
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you: 
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison. 
ISABELLA 
Woe me! for what? 
LUCIO 
For that which, if myself might be his judge, 
He should receive his punishment in thanks: 
He hath got his friend with child. 
ISABELLA 
Sir, make me not your story. 

LUCIO 
It is true. 
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin 
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest, 
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so: 
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted. 
By your renouncement an immortal spirit, 
And to be talk'd with in sincerity, 
As with a saint. 
ISABELLA 
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me. 
LUCIO 
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus: 
Your brother and his lover have embraced: 
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time 
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings 
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb 
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry. 
ISABELLA 
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet? 
LUCIO 
Is she your cousin? 
ISABELLA 
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names 
By vain though apt affection. 
LUCIO 
She it is. 

ISABELLA 
O, let him marry her. 
LUCIO 
This is the point. 
The duke is very strangely gone from hence; 
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, 
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn 
By those that know the very nerves of state, 
His givings-out were of an infinite distance 
From his true-meant design. Upon his place, 
And with full line of his authority, 
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood 
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels 
The wanton stings and motions of the sense, 
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge 
With profits of the mind, study and fast. 
He--to give fear to use and liberty, 
Which have for long run by the hideous law, 
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act, 
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life 
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it; 
And follows close the rigour of the statute, 
To make him an example. All hope is gone, 
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer 
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business 
'Twixt you and your poor brother. 
ISABELLA 
Doth he so seek his life? 
LUCIO 
Has censured him 
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath 
A warrant for his execution. 
ISABELLA 

Alas! what poor ability's in me 
To do him good? 
LUCIO 
Assay the power you have. 
ISABELLA 
My power? Alas, I doubt-- 
LUCIO 
Our doubts are traitors 
And make us lose the good we oft might win 
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo, 
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue, 
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, 
All their petitions are as freely theirs 
As they themselves would owe them. 
ISABELLA 
I'll see what I can do. 
LUCIO 
But speedily. 
ISABELLA 
I will about it straight; 
No longer staying but to give the mother 
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you: 
Commend me to my brother: soon at night 
I'll send him certain word of my success. 
LUCIO 
I take my leave of you. 

ISABELLA 
Good sir, adieu.

SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house. 
Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind 
ANGELO 
We must not make a scarecrow of the law, 
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, 
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it 
Their perch and not their terror. 
ESCALUS 
Ay, but yet 
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little, 
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman 
Whom I would save, had a most noble father! 
Let but your honour know, 
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue, 
That, in the working of your own affections, 
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing, 
Or that the resolute acting of your blood 
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose, 
Whether you had not sometime in your life 
Err'd in this point which now you censure him, 
And pull'd the law upon you. 
ANGELO 
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, 
Another thing to fall. I not deny, 
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life, 
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two 
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice, 
That justice seizes: what know the laws 
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant, 

The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't 
Because we see it; but what we do not see 
We tread upon, and never think of it. 
You may not so extenuate his offence 
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me, 
When I, that censure him, do so offend, 
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death, 
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die. 
ESCALUS 
Be it as your wisdom will. 
ANGELO 
Where is the provost? 
Provost 
Here, if it like your honour. 
ANGELO 
See that Claudio 
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning: 
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared; 
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage. 
Exit Provost 
ESCALUS 
[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all! 
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall: 
Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none: 
And some condemned for a fault alone. 
Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY 
ELBOW 

Come, bring them away: if these be good people in 
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in 
common houses, I know no law: bring them away. 
ANGELO 
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter? 
ELBOW 
If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's 
constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon 
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good 
honour two notorious benefactors. 
ANGELO 
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are 
they not malefactors? 
ELBOW 
If it? please your honour, I know not well what they 
are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure 
of; and void of all profanation in the world that 
good Christians ought to have. 
ESCALUS 
This comes off well; here's a wise officer. 
ANGELO 
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your 
name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow? 
POMPEY 
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow. 
ANGELO 

What are you, sir? 
ELBOW 
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that 
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they 
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she 
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too. 
ESCALUS 
How know you that? 
ELBOW 
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,-- 
ESCALUS 
How? thy wife? 
ELBOW 
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,-- 
ESCALUS 
Dost thou detest her therefore? 
ELBOW 
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as 
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, 
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house. 
ESCALUS 
How dost thou know that, constable? 
ELBOW 

Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman 
cardinally given, might have been accused in 
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there. 
ESCALUS 
By the woman's means? 
ELBOW 
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she 
spit in his face, so she defied him. 
POMPEY 
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so. 
ELBOW 
Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable 
man; prove it. 
ESCALUS 
Do you hear how he misplaces? 
POMPEY 
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, 
saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes; 
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very 
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a 
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen 
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very 
good dishes,-- 
ESCALUS 
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir. 
POMPEY 

No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in 
the right: but to the point. As I say, this 
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and 
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for 
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, 
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the 
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very 
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could 
not give you three-pence again. 
FROTH 
No, indeed. 
POMPEY 
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered, 
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,-- 
FROTH 
Ay, so I did indeed. 
POMPEY 
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be 
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past 
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very 
good diet, as I told you,-- 
FROTH 
All this is true. 
POMPEY 
Why, very well, then,
