tipholus, look strange and frown: 
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects; 
I am not Adriana nor thy wife. 
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow 
That never words were music to thine ear, 
That never object pleasing in thine eye, 
That never touch well welcome to thy hand, 
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste, 
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee. 
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it, 
That thou art thus estranged from thyself? 
Thyself I call it, being strange to me, 
That, undividable, incorporate, 
Am better than thy dear self's better part. 
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me! 
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall 
A drop of water in the breaking gulf, 
And take unmingled that same drop again, 
Without addition or diminishing, 
As take from me thyself and not me too. 
How dearly would it touch me to the quick, 
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious 

And that this body, consecrate to thee, 
By ruffian lust should be contaminate! 
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me 
And hurl the name of husband in my face 
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow 
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring 
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow? 
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it. 
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot; 
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust: 
For if we too be one and thou play false, 
I do digest the poison of thy flesh, 
Being strumpeted by thy contagion. 
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed; 
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not: 
In Ephesus I am but two hours old, 
As strange unto your town as to your talk; 
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd, 
Want wit in all one word to understand. 
LUCIANA 
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you! 
When were you wont to use my sister thus? 
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
By Dromio? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
By me? 
ADRIANA 

By thee; and this thou didst return from him, 
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows, 
Denied my house for his, me for his wife. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? 
What is the course and drift of your compact? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I, sir? I never saw her till this time. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words 
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I never spake with her in all my life. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
How can she thus then call us by our names, 
Unless it be by inspiration. 
ADRIANA 
How ill agrees it with your gravity 
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, 
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood! 
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt, 
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. 
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine: 
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, 
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, 
Makes me with thy strength to communicate: 
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, 

Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss; 
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion 
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme: 
What, was I married to her in my dream? 
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this? 
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss? 
Until I know this sure uncertainty, 
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy. 
LUCIANA 
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner. 
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites! 
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites: 
If we obey them not, this will ensue, 
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue. 
LUCIANA 
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not? 
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot! 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I am transformed, master, am I not? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I think thou art in mind, and so am I. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 

Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Thou hast thine own form. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, I am an ape. 
LUCIANA 
If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass. 
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be 
But I should know her as well as she knows me. 
ADRIANA 
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool, 
To put the finger in the eye and weep, 
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn. 
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate. 
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day 
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. 
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master, 
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. 
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? 
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised? 
Known unto these, and to myself disguised! 
I'll say as they say and persever so, 
And in this mist at all adventures go. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, shall I be porter at the gate? 
ADRIANA 
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate. 
LUCIANA 
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all; 
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours: 
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop 
To see the making of her carcanet, 
And that to-morrow you will bring it home. 
But here's a villain that would face me down 
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him, 
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold, 
And that I did deny my wife and house. 
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know; 
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show: 
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, 
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I think thou art an ass. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Marry, so it doth appear 
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear. 
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass, 

You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer 
May answer my good will and your good welcome here. 
BALTHAZAR 
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your 
welcome dear. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish, 
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish. 
BALTHAZAR 
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words. 
BALTHAZAR 
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest: 
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part; 
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart. 
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 

Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn! 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, 
idiot, patch! 
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch. 
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st 
for such store, 
When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in 
the street. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he 
catch cold on's feet. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Who talks within there? ho, open the door! 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell 
me wherefore. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again 
when you may. 
ANTIPHOLUS 

OF EPHESUS 
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name 
is Dromio. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name. 
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame. 
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place, 
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy 
name for an ass. 
LUCE 
[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those 
at the gate? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Let my master in, Luce. 
LUCE 
[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late; 
And so tell your master. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
O Lord, I must laugh! 
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff? 
LUCE 
[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When? 
can you tell? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast 
answered him well. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope? 
OF EPHESUS 
LUCE 
[Within] I thought to have asked you. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] And you said no. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Thou baggage, let me in. 
LUCE 
[Within] Can you tell for whose sake? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Master, knock the door hard. 
LUCE 
[Within] Let him knock till it ache. 
ANTIPHOLUS 

OF EPHESUS 
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down. 
LUCE 
[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town? 
ADRIANA 
[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all 
this noise? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with 
unruly boys. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Are you there, wife? you might have come before. 
ADRIANA 
[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore. 
ANGELO 
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would 
fain have either. 
BALTHAZAR 
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 

They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin. 
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold: 
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your 
knave's pate. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind, 
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon 
thee, hind! 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee, 
let me in. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 

[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
A crow without feather? Master, mean you so? 
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather; 
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow. 
BALTHAZAR 
Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so! 
Herein you war against your reputation 
And draw within the compass of suspect 
The unviolated honour of your wife. 
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom, 
Her sober virtue, years and modesty, 
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown: 
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse 
Why at this time the doors are made against you. 
Be ruled by me: depart in patience, 
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, 
And about evening come yourself alone 
To know the reason of this strange restraint. 
If by strong hand you offer to break in 
Now in the stirring passage of the day, 
A vulgar comment will be made of it, 
And that supposed by the common rout 
Against your yet ungalled estimation 
That may with foul intrusion enter in 
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead; 
For slander lives upon succession, 
For ever housed where it gets possession. 

ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet, 
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry. 
I know a wench of excellent discourse, 
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle: 
There will we dine. This woman that I mean, 
My wife--but, I protest, without desert-- 
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal: 
To her will we to dinner. 
To Angelo 
Get you home 
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made: 
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine; 
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow-- 
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-- 
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste. 
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me, 
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me. 
ANGELO 
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

SCENE II. The same. 
Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 
LUCIANA 
And may it be that you have quite forgot 
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus. 
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot? 
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous? 
If you did wed my sister for her wealth, 
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness: 
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth; 
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness: 
Let not my sister read it in your eye; 
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator; 
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty; 
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger; 
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted; 
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; 
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted? 
What simple thief brags of his own attaint? 
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed 
And let her read it in thy looks at board: 
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed; 
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word. 
Alas, poor women! make us but believe, 
Being compact of credit, that you love us; 
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; 
We in your motion turn and you may move us. 
Then, gentle brother, get you in again; 
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife: 
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain, 
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 

Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not, 
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,-- 
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not 
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine. 
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak; 
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit, 
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak, 
The folded meaning of your words' deceit. 
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you 
To make it wander in an unknown field? 
Are you a god? would you create me new? 
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield. 
But if that I am I, then well I know 
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine, 
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe 
Far more, far more to you do I decline. 
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note, 
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears: 
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote: 
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs, 
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie, 
And in that glorious supposition think 
He gains by death that hath such means to die: 
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink! 
LUCIANA 
What, are you mad, that you do reason so? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know. 
LUCIANA 
It is a fault that springeth from your eye. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 

For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by. 
LUCIANA 
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night. 
LUCIANA 
Why call you me love? call my sister so. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Thy sister's sister. 
LUCIANA 
That's my sister. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
No; 
It is thyself, mine own self's better part, 
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart, 
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim, 
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim. 
LUCIANA 
All this my sister is, or else should be. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee. 

Thee will I love and with thee lead my life: 
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife. 
Give me thy hand. 
LUCIANA 
O, soft, air! hold you still: 
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will. 
Exit 
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man? 
am I myself? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one 
that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me. 

ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What claim lays she to thee? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your 
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I 
being a beast, she would have me; but that she, 
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What is she? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may 
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have 
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a 
wondrous fat marriage. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
How dost thou mean a fat marriage? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease; 
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a 
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I 
warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a 
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday, 
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 

What complexion is she of? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so 
clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over 
shoes in the grime of it. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
That's a fault that water will mend. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What's her name? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's 
an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from 
hip to hip. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Then she bears some breadth? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: 
she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out 
countries in her. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 

In what part of her body stands Ireland? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Where Scotland? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Where France? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war 
against her heir. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Where England? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no 
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin, 
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Where Spain? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Where America, the Indies? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with 
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich 
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole 
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this 
drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me 
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what 
privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my 
shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my 
left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch: 
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of 
faith and my heart of steel, 
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made 
me turn i' the wheel. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Go hie thee presently, post to the road: 
An if the wind blow any way from shore, 
I will not harbour in this town to-night: 
If any bark put forth, come to the mart, 

Where I will walk till thou return to me. 
If every one knows us and we know none, 
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
As from a bear a man would run for life, 
So fly I from her that would be my wife. 
Exit 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
There's none but witches do inhabit here; 
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence. 
She that doth call me husband, even my soul 
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister, 
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace, 
Of such enchanting presence and discourse, 
Hath almost made me traitor to myself: 
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong, 
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song. 
Enter ANGELO with the chain 
ANGELO 
Master Antipholus,-- 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Ay, that's my name. 
ANGELO 
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain. 
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine: 
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long. 

ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What is your will that I shall do with this? 
ANGELO 
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not. 
ANGELO 
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have. 
Go home with it and please your wife withal; 
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you 
And then receive my money for the chain. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I pray you, sir, receive the money now, 
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more. 
ANGELO 
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well. 
Exit 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What I should think of this, I cannot tell: 
But this I think, there's no man is so vain 
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain. 

I see a man here needs not live by shifts, 
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts. 
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay 
If any ship put out, then straight away.

SCENE I. A public place. 
Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer 
Second Merchant 
You know since Pentecost the sum is due, 
And since I have not much importuned you; 
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound 
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage: 
Therefore make present satisfaction, 
Or I'll attach you by this officer. 
ANGELO 
Even just the sum that I do owe to you 
Is growing to me by Antipholus, 
And in the instant that I met with you 
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock 
I shall receive the money for the same. 
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, 
I will discharge my bond and thank you too. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's 
Officer 
That labour may you save: see where he comes. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou 
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow 
Among my wife and her confederates, 
For locking me out of my doors by day. 

But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone; 
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope. 
Exit 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
A man is well holp up that trusts to you: 
I promised your presence and the chain; 
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me. 
Belike you thought our love would last too long, 
If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not. 
ANGELO 
Saving your merry humour, here's the note 
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, 
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion. 
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more 
Than I stand debted to this gentleman: 
I pray you, see him presently discharged, 
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I am not furnish'd with the present money; 
Besides, I have some business in the town. 
Good signior, take the stranger to my house 
And with you take the chain and bid my wife 
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof: 
Perchance I will be there as soon as you. 
ANGELO 
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself? 

ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough. 
ANGELO 
Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have; 
Or else you may return without your money. 
ANGELO 
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain: 
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, 
And I, to blame, have held him here too long. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse 
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine. 
I should have chid you for not bringing it, 
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl. 
Second Merchant 
The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch. 
ANGELO 
You hear how he importunes me;--the chain! 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 

Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money. 
ANGELO 
Come, come, you know I gave it you even now. 
Either send the chain or send me by some token. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath, 
where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it. 
Second Merchant 
My business cannot brook this dalliance. 
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no: 
If not, I'll leave him to the officer. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I answer you! what should I answer you? 
ANGELO 
The money that you owe me for the chain. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I owe you none till I receive the chain. 
ANGELO 
You know I gave it you half an hour since. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so. 

ANGELO 
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it: 
Consider how it stands upon my credit. 
Second Merchant 
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit. 
Officer 
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me. 
ANGELO 
This touches me in reputation. 
Either consent to pay this sum for me 
Or I attach you by this officer. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Consent to pay thee that I never had! 
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest. 
ANGELO 
Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer, 
I would not spare my brother in this case, 
If he should scorn me so apparently. 
Officer 
I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I do obey thee till I give thee bail. 
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear 

As all the metal in your shop will answer. 
ANGELO 
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus, 
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not. 
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum 
That stays but till her owner comes aboard, 
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir, 
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought 
The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae. 
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind 
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all 
But for their owner, master, and yourself. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep, 
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope; 
And told thee to what purpose and what end. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
You sent me for a rope's end as soon: 
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark. 
ANTIPHOLUS 

OF EPHESUS 
I will debate this matter at more leisure 
And teach your ears to list me with more heed. 
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight: 
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk 
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry, 
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it: 
Tell her I am arrested in the street 
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone! 
On, officer, to prison till it come. 
Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
To Adriana! that is where we dined, 
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband: 
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass. 
Thither I must, although against my will, 
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. 
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA 
ADRIANA 
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so? 
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye 
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no? 
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily? 
What observation madest thou in this case 
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face? 
LUCIANA 
First he denied you had in him no right. 
ADRIANA 
He meant he did me none; the more my spite. 
LUCIANA 
Then swore he that he was a stranger here. 
ADRIANA 
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were. 
LUCIANA 
Then pleaded I for you. 
ADRIANA 

And what said he? 
LUCIANA 
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me. 
ADRIANA 
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love? 
LUCIANA 
With words that in an honest suit might move. 
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech. 
ADRIANA 
Didst speak him fair? 
LUCIANA 
Have patience, I beseech. 
ADRIANA 
I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still; 
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will. 
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere, 
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere; 
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind; 
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind. 
LUCIANA 
Who would be jealous then of such a one? 
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone. 
ADRIANA 
Ah, but I think him better than I say, 
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse. 

Far from her nest the lapwing cries away: 
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse. 
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste. 
LUCIANA 
How hast thou lost thy breath? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
By running fast. 
ADRIANA 
Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. 
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him; 
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel; 
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough; 
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff; 
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that 
countermands 
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands; 
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well; 
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell. 
ADRIANA 
Why, man, what is the matter? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case. 

ADRIANA 
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well; 
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell. 
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk? 
ADRIANA 
Go fetch it, sister. 
Exit Luciana 
This I wonder at, 
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt. 
Tell me, was he arrested on a band? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Not on a band, but on a stronger thing; 
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring? 
ADRIANA 
What, the chain? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone: 
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock 
strikes one. 
ADRIANA 
The hours come back! that did I never hear. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 

O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for 
very fear. 
ADRIANA 
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason! 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's 
worth, to season. 
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say 
That Time comes stealing on by night and day? 
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, 
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day? 
Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse 
ADRIANA 
Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight; 
And bring thy master home immediately. 
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit-- 
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

SCENE III. A public place. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me 
As if I were their well-acquainted friend; 
And every one doth call me by my name. 
Some tender money to me; some invite me; 
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses; 
Some offer me commodities to buy: 
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop 
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me, 
And therewithal took measure of my body. 
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles 
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here. 
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have 
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam 
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's 

skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came 
behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you 
forsake your liberty. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I understand thee not. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a 
bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, 
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob 
and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed 
men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up 
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a 
morris-pike. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
What, thou meanest an officer? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings 
any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that 
thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God 
give you good rest!' 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the 
bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were 
you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy 
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to 

deliver you. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
The fellow is distract, and so am I; 
And here we wander in illusions: 
Some blessed power deliver us from hence! 
Enter a Courtezan 
Courtezan 
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus. 
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now: 
Is that the chain you promised me to-day? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, is this Mistress Satan? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
It is the devil. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here 
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof 
comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as 
much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is 
written, they appear to men like angels of light: 
light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn; 
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her. 

Courtezan 
Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir. 
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a 
long spoon. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Why, Dromio? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with 
the devil. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping? 
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress: 
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone. 
Courtezan 
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner, 
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised, 
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, 
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, 
A nut, a cherry-stone; 
But she, more covetous, would have a chain. 
Master, be wise: an if you give it her, 
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it. 

Courtezan 
I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain: 
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know. 
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse 
Courtezan 
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad, 
Else would he never so demean himself. 
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, 
And for the same he promised me a chain: 
Both one and other he denies me now. 
The reason that I gather he is mad, 
Besides this present instance of his rage, 
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner, 
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance. 
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, 
On purpose shut the doors against his way. 
My way is now to hie home to his house, 
And tell his wife that, being lunatic, 
He rush'd into my house and took perforce 
My ring away. This course I fittest choose; 
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

SCENE IV. A street. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Fear me not, man; I will not break away: 
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money, 
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for. 
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day, 
And will not lightly trust the messenger 
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus, 
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears. 
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end 
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money. 
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
But where's the money? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 

Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you. 
Beating him 
Officer 
Good sir, be patient. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity. 
Officer 
Good, now, hold thy tongue. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 

Thou whoreson, senseless villain! 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel 
your blows. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an 
ass. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long 
ears. I have served him from the hour of my 
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his 
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he 
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me 
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep; 
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with 
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when 
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a 
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath 
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder. 
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or 
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the 
rope's-end.' 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 

Wilt thou still talk? 
Beating him 
Courtezan 
How say you now? is not your husband mad? 
ADRIANA 
His incivility confirms no less. 
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer; 
Establish him in his true sense again, 
And I will please you what you will demand. 
LUCIANA 
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks! 
Courtezan 
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy! 
PINCH 
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear. 
Striking him 
PINCH 
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man, 
To yield possession to my holy prayers 
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight: 
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven! 
ANTIPHOLUS 

OF EPHESUS 
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad. 
ADRIANA 
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul! 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
You minion, you, are these your customers? 
Did this companion with the saffron face 
Revel and feast it at my house to-day, 
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut 
And I denied to enter in my house? 
ADRIANA 
O husband, God doth know you dined at home; 
Where would you had remain'd until this time, 
Free from these slanders and this open shame! 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out. 

ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
And did not she herself revile me there? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
And did not I in rage depart from thence? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
In verity you did; my bones bear witness, 
That since have felt the vigour of his rage. 
ADRIANA 
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries? 
PINCH 
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein, 
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 

Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me. 
ADRIANA 
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you, 
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might; 
But surely master, not a rag of money. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats? 
ADRIANA 
He came to me and I deliver'd it. 
LUCIANA 
And I am witness with her that she did. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
God and the rope-maker bear me witness 
That I was sent for nothing but a rope! 
PINCH 
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd; 
I know it by their pale and deadly looks: 
They must be bound and laid in some dark room. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day? 
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold? 

ADRIANA 
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
And, gentle master, I received no gold; 
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out. 
ADRIANA 
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all; 
And art confederate with a damned pack 
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me: 
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes 
That would behold in me this shameful sport. 
Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives 
ADRIANA 
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me. 
PINCH 
More company! The fiend is strong within him. 
LUCIANA 
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks! 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou, 

I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them 
To make a rescue? 
Officer 
Masters, let him go 
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him. 
PINCH 
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too. 
They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus 
ADRIANA 
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer? 
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man 
Do outrage and displeasure to himself? 
Officer 
He is my prisoner: if I let him go, 
The debt he owes will be required of me. 
ADRIANA 
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee: 
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, 
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it. 
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd 
Home to my house. O most unhappy day! 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
O most unhappy strumpet! 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Master, I am here entered in bond for you. 

ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master: 
cry 'The devil!' 
LUCIANA 
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk! 
ADRIANA 
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me. 
Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan 
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at? 
Officer 
One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him? 
ADRIANA 
I know the man. What is the sum he owes? 
Officer 
Two hundred ducats. 
ADRIANA 
Say, how grows it due? 
Officer 

Due for a chain your husband had of him. 
ADRIANA 
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not. 
Courtezan 
When as your husband all in rage to-day 
Came to my house and took away my ring-- 
The ring I saw upon his finger now-- 
Straight after did I meet him with a chain. 
ADRIANA 
It may be so, but I did never see it. 
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is: 
I long to know the truth hereof at large. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse 
LUCIANA 
God, for thy mercy! they are loose again. 
ADRIANA 
And come with naked swords. 
Let's call more help to have them bound again. 
Officer 
Away! they'll kill us. 
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I see these witches are afraid of swords. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
She that would be your wife now ran from you. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence: 
I long that we were safe and sound aboard. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us 
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold: 
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for 
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of 
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and 
turn witch. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I will not stay to-night for all the town; 
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

SCENE I. A street before a Priory. 
Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO 
ANGELO 
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you; 
But, I protest, he had the chain of me, 
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it. 
Second Merchant 
How is the man esteemed here in the city? 
ANGELO 
Of very reverend reputation, sir, 
Of credit infinite, highly beloved, 
Second to none that lives here in the city: 
His word might bear my wealth at any time. 
Second Merchant 
Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse 
ANGELO 
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck 
Which he forswore most monstrously to have. 
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him. 
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much 
That you would put me to this shame and trouble; 
And, not without some scandal to yourself, 
With circumstance and oaths so to deny 

This chain which now you wear so openly: 
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, 
You have done wrong to this my honest friend, 
Who, but for staying on our controversy, 
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day: 
This chain you had of me; can you deny it? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I think I had; I never did deny it. 
Second Merchant 
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it? 
Second Merchant 
These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee. 
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest 
To walk where any honest man resort. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus: 
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty 
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand. 
Second Merchant 
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain. 
They draw 
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others 

ADRIANA 
Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad. 
Some get within him, take his sword away: 
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house! 
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd! 
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory 
Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA 
AEMELIA 
Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither? 
ADRIANA 
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence. 
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast 
And bear him home for his recovery. 
ANGELO 
I knew he was not in his perfect wits. 
Second Merchant 
I am sorry now that I did draw on him. 
AEMELIA 
How long hath this possession held the man? 
ADRIANA 
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, 

And much different from the man he was; 
But till this afternoon his passion 
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage. 
AEMELIA 
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea? 
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye 
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love? 
A sin prevailing much in youthful men, 
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. 
Which of these sorrows is he subject to? 
ADRIANA 
To none of these, except it be the last; 
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home. 
AEMELIA 
You should for that have reprehended him. 
ADRIANA 
Why, so I did. 
AEMELIA 
Ay, but not rough enough. 
ADRIANA 
As roughly as my modesty would let me. 
AEMELIA 
Haply, in private. 
ADRIANA 
And in assemblies too. 

AEMELIA 
Ay, but not enough. 
ADRIANA 
It was the copy of our conference: 
In bed he slept not for my urging it; 
At board he fed not for my urging it; 
Alone, it was the subject of my theme; 
In company I often glanced it; 
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad. 
AEMELIA 
And thereof came it that the man was mad. 
The venom clamours of a jealous woman 
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth. 
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing, 
And therefore comes it that his head is light. 
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings: 
Unquiet meals make ill digestions; 
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred; 
And what's a fever but a fit of madness? 
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls: 
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue 
But moody and dull melancholy, 
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, 
And at her heels a huge infectious troop 
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? 
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest 
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast: 
The consequence is then thy jealous fits 
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits. 
LUCIANA 
She never reprehended him but mildly, 
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly. 
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not? 

ADRIANA 
She did betray me to my own reproof. 
Good people enter and lay hold on him. 
AEMELIA 
No, not a creature enters in my house. 
ADRIANA 
Then let your servants bring my husband forth. 
AEMELIA 
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary, 
And it shall privilege him from your hands 
Till I have brought him to his wits again, 
Or lose my labour in assaying it. 
ADRIANA 
I will attend my husband, be his nurse, 
Diet his sickness, for it is my office, 
And will have no attorney but myself; 
And therefore let me have him home with me. 
AEMELIA 
Be patient; for I will not let him stir 
Till I have used the approved means I have, 
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers, 
To make of him a formal man again: 
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, 
A charitable duty of my order. 
Therefore depart and leave him here with me. 
ADRIANA 
I will not hence and leave my husband here: 
And ill it doth beseem your holiness 

To separate the husband and the wife. 
AEMELIA 
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him. 
Exit 
LUCIANA 
Complain unto the duke of this indignity. 
ADRIANA 
Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet 
And never rise until my tears and prayers 
Have won his grace to come in person hither 
And take perforce my husband from the abbess. 
Second Merchant 
By this, I think, the dial points at five: 
Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person 
Comes this way to the melancholy vale, 
The place of death and sorry execution, 
Behind the ditches of the abbey here. 
ANGELO 
Upon what cause? 
Second Merchant 
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, 
Who put unluckily into this bay 
Against the laws and statutes of this town, 
Beheaded publicly for his offence. 
ANGELO 
See where they come: we will behold his death. 

LUCIANA 
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey. 
Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other 
Officers 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Yet once again proclaim it publicly, 
If any friend will pay the sum for him, 
He shall not die; so much we tender him. 
ADRIANA 
Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess! 
DUKE SOLINUS 
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady: 
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong. 
ADRIANA 
May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband, 
Whom I made lord of me and all I had, 
At your important letters,--this ill day 
A most outrageous fit of madness took him; 
That desperately he hurried through the street, 
With him his bondman, all as mad as he-- 
Doing displeasure to the citizens 
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence 
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like. 
Once did I get him bound and sent him home, 
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, 
That here and there his fury had committed. 
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, 
He broke from those that had the guard of him; 
And with his mad attendant and himself, 
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, 
Met us again and madly bent on us, 

Chased us away; till, raising of more aid, 
We came again to bind them. Then they fled 
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them: 
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us 
And will not suffer us to fetch him out, 
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. 
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command 
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Long since thy husband served me in my wars, 
And I to thee engaged a prince's word, 
When thou didst make him master of thy bed, 
To do him all the grace and good I could. 
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate 
And bid the lady abbess come to me. 
I will determine this before I stir. 
Enter a Servant 
Servant 
O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself! 
My master and his man are both broke loose, 
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor 
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire; 
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him 
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair: 
My master preaches patience to him and the while 
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool, 
And sure, unless you send some present help, 
Between them they will kill the conjurer. 
ADRIANA 
Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here, 
And that is false thou dost report to us. 
Servant 
Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true; 

I have not breathed almost since I did see it. 
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, 
To scorch your face and to disfigure you. 
Cry within 
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone! 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds! 
ADRIANA 
Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you, 
That he is borne about invisible: 
Even now we housed him in the abbey here; 
And now he's there, past thought of human reason. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice! 
Even for the service that long since I did thee, 
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took 
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood 
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice. 
AEGEON 
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, 
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there! 
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife, 

That hath abused and dishonour'd me 
Even in the strength and height of injury! 
Beyond imagination is the wrong 
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me, 
While she with harlots feasted in my house. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so? 
ADRIANA 
No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister 
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul 
As this is false he burdens me withal! 
LUCIANA 
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night, 
But she tells to your highness simple truth! 
ANGELO 
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn: 
In this the madman justly chargeth them. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
My liege, I am advised what I say, 
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, 
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, 

Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. 
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner: 
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, 
Could witness it, for he was with me then; 
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, 
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, 
Where Balthazar and I did dine together. 
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither, 
I went to seek him: in the street I met him 
And in his company that gentleman. 
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down 
That I this day of him received the chain, 
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which 
He did arrest me with an officer. 
I did obey, and sent my peasant home 
For certain ducats: he with none return'd 
Then fairly I bespoke the officer 
To go in person with me to my house. 
By the way we met 
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more 
Of vile confederates. Along with them 
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain, 
A mere anatomy, a mountebank, 
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller, 
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, 
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave, 
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, 
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, 
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me, 
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together 
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence 
And in a dark and dankish vault at home 
There left me and my man, both bound together; 
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, 
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately 
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech 
To give me ample satisfaction 
For these deep shames and great indignities. 
ANGELO 
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him, 
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out. 

DUKE SOLINUS 
But had he such a chain of thee or no? 
ANGELO 
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here, 
These people saw the chain about his neck. 
Second Merchant 
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine 
Heard you confess you had the chain of him 
After you first forswore it on the mart: 
And thereupon I drew my sword on you; 
And then you fled into this abbey here, 
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I never came within these abbey-walls, 
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me: 
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! 
And this is false you burden me withal. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Why, what an intricate impeach is this! 
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup. 
If here you housed him, here he would have been; 
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly: 
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here 
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine. 
Courtezan 

He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here? 
Courtezan 
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither. 
I think you are all mated or stark mad. 
Exit one to Abbess 
AEGEON 
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: 
Haply I see a friend will save my life 
And pay the sum that may deliver me. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt. 
AEGEON 
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus? 
And is not that your bondman, Dromio? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Within this hour I was his bondman sir, 
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords: 

Now am I Dromio and his man unbound. 
AEGEON 
I am sure you both of you remember me. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you; 
For lately we were bound, as you are now 
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir? 
AEGEON 
Why look you strange on me? you know me well. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
I never saw you in my life till now. 
AEGEON 
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, 
And careful hours with time's deformed hand 
Have written strange defeatures in my face: 
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Neither. 
AEGEON 
Dromio, nor thou? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
No, trust me, sir, nor I. 
AEGEON 

I am sure thou dost. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a 
man denies, you are now bound to believe him. 
AEGEON 
Not know my voice! O time's extremity, 
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue 
In seven short years, that here my only son 
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares? 
Though now this grained face of mine be hid 
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow, 
And all the conduits of my blood froze up, 
Yet hath my night of life some memory, 
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, 
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear: 
All these old witnesses--I cannot err-- 
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I never saw my father in my life. 
AEGEON 
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, 
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son, 
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
The duke and all that know me in the city 
Can witness with me that it is not so 
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life. 
DUKE SOLINUS 

I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years 
Have I been patron to Antipholus, 
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa: 
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote. 
Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse 
AEMELIA 
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd. 
All gather to see them 
ADRIANA 
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
One of these men is Genius to the other; 
And so of these. Which is the natural man, 
And which the spirit? who deciphers them? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I, sir, am Dromio; command him away. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
O, my old master! who hath bound him here? 

AEMELIA 
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds 
And gain a husband by his liberty. 
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man 
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia 
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons: 
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak, 
And speak unto the same AEmilia! 
AEGEON 
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia: 
If thou art she, tell me where is that son 
That floated with thee on the fatal raft? 
AEMELIA 
By men of Epidamnum he and I 
And the twin Dromio all were taken up; 
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth 
By force took Dromio and my son from them 
And me they left with those of Epidamnum. 
What then became of them I cannot tell 
I to this fortune that you see me in. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
Why, here begins his morning story right; 
These two Antipholuses, these two so like, 
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,-- 
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,-- 
These are the parents to these children, 
Which accidentally are met together. 
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse. 
DUKE SOLINUS 

Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,-- 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
And I with him. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior, 
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle. 
ADRIANA 
Which of you two did dine with me to-day? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I, gentle mistress. 
ADRIANA 
And are not you my husband? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
No; I say nay to that. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
And so do I; yet did she call me so: 
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, 

Did call me brother. 
To Luciana 
What I told you then, 
I hope I shall have leisure to make good; 
If this be not a dream I see and hear. 
ANGELO 
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
I think it be, sir; I deny it not. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me. 
ANGELO 
I think I did, sir; I deny it not. 
ADRIANA 
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail, 
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
No, none by me. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
This purse of ducats I received from you, 
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me. 
I see we still did meet each other's man, 

And I was ta'en for him, and he for me, 
And thereupon these errors are arose. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
These ducats pawn I for my father here. 
DUKE SOLINUS 
It shall not need; thy father hath his life. 
Courtezan 
Sir, I must have that diamond from you. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer. 
AEMELIA 
Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains 
To go with us into the abbey here 
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes: 
And all that are assembled in this place, 
That by this sympathized one day's error 
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company, 
And we shall make full satisfaction. 
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail 
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour 
My heavy burden ne'er delivered. 
The duke, my husband and my children both, 
And you the calendars of their nativity, 
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me; 
After so long grief, such festivity! 
DUKE SOLINUS 
With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast. 

Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and 
Dromio of Ephesus 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard? 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF EPHESUS 
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur. 
ANTIPHOLUS 
OF SYRACUSE 
He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio: 
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon: 
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him. 
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
There is a fat friend at your master's house, 
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner: 
She now shall be my sister, not my wife. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: 
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. 
Will you walk in to see their gossiping? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Not I, sir; you are my elder. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
That's a question: how shall we try it? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, then, thus: 
We came into the world like brother and brother; 
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another. 
Exeunt

SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter two Gentlemen 
First Gentleman 
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods 
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers 
Still seem as does the king. 
Second Gentleman 
But what's the matter? 
First Gentleman 
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom 
He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow 
That late he married--hath referr'd herself 
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded; 
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all 
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king 
Be touch'd at very heart. 
Second Gentleman 
None but the king? 
First Gentleman 
He that hath lost her too; so is the queen, 
That most desired the match; but not a courtier, 
Although they wear their faces to the bent 
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not 
Glad at the thing they scowl at. 

Second Gentleman 
And why so? 
First Gentleman 
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing 
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her-- 
I mean, that married her, alack, good man! 
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such 
As, to seek through the regions of the earth 
For one his like, there would be something failing 
In him that should compare. I do not think 
So fair an outward and such stuff within 
Endows a man but he. 
Second Gentleman 
You speak him far. 
First Gentleman 
I do extend him, sir, within himself, 
Crush him together rather than unfold 
His measure duly. 
Second Gentleman 
What's his name and birth? 
First Gentleman 
I cannot delve him to the root: his father 
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour 
Against the Romans with Cassibelan, 
But had his titles by Tenantius whom 
He served with glory and admired success, 
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus; 
And had, besides this gentleman in question, 
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time 
Died with their swords in hand; for which 
their father, 

Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow 
That he quit being, and his gentle lady, 
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased 
As he was born. The king he takes the babe 
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus, 
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber, 
Puts to him all the learnings that his time 
Could make him the receiver of; which he took, 
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd, 
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court-- 
Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved, 
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature 
A glass that feated them, and to the graver 
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress, 
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price 
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue; 
By her election may be truly read 
What kind of man he is. 
Second Gentleman 
I honour him 
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me, 
Is she sole child to the king? 
First Gentleman 
His only child. 
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing, 
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old, 
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery 
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge 
Which way they went. 
Second Gentleman 
How long is this ago? 
First Gentleman 
Some twenty years. 

Second Gentleman 
That a king's children should be so convey'd, 
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow, 
That could not trace them! 
First Gentleman 
Howsoe'er 'tis strange, 
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at, 
Yet is it true, sir. 
Second Gentleman 
I do well believe you. 
First Gentleman 
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman, 
The queen, and princess. 
Exeunt 
Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN 
QUEEN 
No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter, 
After the slander of most stepmothers, 
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but 
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys 
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus, 
So soon as I can win the offended king, 
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet 
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good 
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience 
Your wisdom may inform you. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Please your highness, 

I will from hence to-day. 
QUEEN 
You know the peril. 
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying 
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king 
Hath charged you should not speak together. 
Exit 
IMOGEN 
O
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant 
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband, 
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing-- 
Always reserved my holy duty--what 
His rage can do on me: you must be gone; 
And I shall here abide the hourly shot 
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live, 
But that there is this jewel in the world 
That I may see again. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
My queen! my mistress! 
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause 
To be suspected of more tenderness 
Than doth become a man. I will remain 
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth: 
My residence in Rome at one Philario's, 
Who to my father was a friend, to me 
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen, 
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send, 
Though ink be made of gall. 
Re-enter QUEEN 
QUEEN 
Be brief, I pray you: 

If the king come, I shall incur I know not 
How much of his displeasure. 
Aside 
Yet I'll move him 
To walk this way: I never do him wrong, 
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends; 
Pays dear for my offences. 
Exit 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Should we be taking leave 
As long a term as yet we have to live, 
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu! 
IMOGEN 
Nay, stay a little: 
Were you but riding forth to air yourself, 
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love; 
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart; 
But keep it till you woo another wife, 
When Imogen is dead. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
How, how! another? 
You gentle gods, give me but this I have, 
And sear up my embracements from a next 
With bonds of death! 
Putting on the ring 
Remain, remain thou here 
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest, 
As I my poor self did exchange for you, 
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles 
I still win of you: for my sake wear this; 
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it 

Upon this fairest prisoner. 
Putting a bracelet upon her arm 
IMOGEN 
O the gods! 
When shall we see again? 
Enter CYMBELINE and Lords 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Alack, the king! 
CYMBELINE 
Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight! 
If after this command thou fraught the court 
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away! 
Thou'rt poison to my blood. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
The gods protect you! 
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone. 
Exit 
IMOGEN 
There cannot be a pinch in death 
More sharp than this is. 
CYMBELINE 
O disloyal thing, 
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st 
A year's age on me. 
IMOGEN 

I beseech you, sir, 
Harm not yourself with your vexation 
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare 
Subdues all pangs, all fears. 
CYMBELINE 
Past grace? obedience? 
IMOGEN 
Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace. 
CYMBELINE 
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen! 
IMOGEN 
O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle, 
And did avoid a puttock. 
CYMBELINE 
Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne 
A seat for baseness. 
IMOGEN 
No; I rather added 
A lustre to it. 
CYMBELINE 
O thou vile one! 
IMOGEN 
Sir, 
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus: 

You bred him as my playfellow, and he is 
A man worth any woman, overbuys me 
Almost the sum he pays. 
CYMBELINE 
What, art thou mad? 
IMOGEN 
Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were 
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus 
Our neighbour shepherd's son! 
CYMBELINE 
Thou foolish thing! 
Re-enter QUEEN 
They were again together: you have done 
Not after our command. Away with her, 
And pen her up. 
QUEEN 
Beseech your patience. Peace, 
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign, 
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort 
Out of your best advice. 
CYMBELINE 
Nay, let her languish 
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged, 
Die of this folly! 
Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords 
QUEEN 

Fie! you must give way. 
Enter PISANIO 
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news? 
PISANIO 
My lord your son drew on my master. 
QUEEN 
Ha! 
No harm, I trust, is done? 
PISANIO 
There might have been, 
But that my master rather play'd than fought 
And had no help of anger: they were parted 
By gentlemen at hand. 
QUEEN 
I am very glad on't. 
IMOGEN 
Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part. 
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir! 
I would they were in Afric both together; 
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick 
The goer-back. Why came you from your master? 
PISANIO 
On his command: he would not suffer me 
To bring him to the haven; left these notes 
Of what commands I should be subject to, 
When 't pleased you to employ me. 

QUEEN 
This hath been 
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour 
He will remain so. 
PISANIO 
I humbly thank your highness. 
QUEEN 
Pray, walk awhile. 
IMOGEN 
About some half-hour hence, 
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least 
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

SCENE II. The same. A public place. 
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords 
First Lord 
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the 
violence of action hath made you reek as a 
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in: 
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent. 
CLOTEN 
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him? 
Second Lord 
[Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience. 
First Lord 
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be 
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' the 
backside the town. 
CLOTEN 
The villain would not stand me. 
Second Lord 

[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face. 
First Lord 
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but 
he added to your having; gave you some ground. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies! 
CLOTEN 
I would they had not come between us. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] So would I, till you had measured how long 
a fool you were upon the ground. 
CLOTEN 
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me! 
Second Lord 
[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she 
is damned. 
First Lord 
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain 
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen 
small reflection of her wit. 
Second Lord 
[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the 
reflection should hurt her. 
CLOTEN 

Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some 
hurt done! 
Second Lord 
[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall 
of an ass, which is no great hurt. 
CLOTEN 
You'll go with us? 
First Lord 
I'll attend your lordship. 
CLOTEN 
Nay, come, let's go together. 
Second Lord 
Well, my lord.

SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO 
IMOGEN 
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven, 
And question'dst every sail: if he should write 
And not have it, 'twere a paper lost, 
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last 
That he spake to thee? 
PISANIO 
It was his queen, his queen! 
IMOGEN 
Then waved his handkerchief? 
PISANIO 
And kiss'd it, madam. 
IMOGEN 
Senseless Linen! happier therein than I! 
And that was all? 
PISANIO 
No, madam; for so long 
As he could make me with this eye or ear 
Distinguish him from others, he did keep 
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief, 
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind 

Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on, 
How swift his ship. 
IMOGEN 
Thou shouldst have made him 
As little as a crow, or less, ere left 
To after-eye him. 
PISANIO 
Madam, so I did. 
IMOGEN 
I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but 
To look upon him, till the diminution 
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle, 
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from 
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then 
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio, 
When shall we hear from him? 
PISANIO 
Be assured, madam, 
With his next vantage. 
IMOGEN 
I did not take my leave of him, but had 
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him 
How I would think on him at certain hours 
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear 
The shes of Italy should not betray 
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him, 
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight, 
To encounter me with orisons, for then 
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could 
Give him that parting kiss which I had set 
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father 
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north 

Shakes all our buds from growing. 
Enter a Lady 
Lady 
The queen, madam, 
Desires your highness' company. 
IMOGEN 
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd. 
I will attend the queen. 
PISANIO 
Madam, I shall.

SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house. 
Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard 
IACHIMO 
Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was 
then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy 
as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I 
could then have looked on him without the help of 
admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments 
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items. 
PHILARIO 
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now 
he is with that which makes him both without and within. 
Frenchman 
I have seen him in France: we had very many there 
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he. 
IACHIMO 
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein 
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, 
words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter. 
Frenchman 
And then his banishment. 
IACHIMO 
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this 

lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully 
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment, 
which else an easy battery might lay flat, for 
taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes 
it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps 
acquaintance? 
PHILARIO 
His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I 
have been often bound for no less than my life. 
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained 
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your 
knowing, to a stranger of his quality. 
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
I beseech you all, be better known to this 
gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend 
of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear 
hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing. 
Frenchman 
Sir, we have known together in Orleans. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, 
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still. 
Frenchman 
Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I 
did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity 
you should have been put together with so mortal a 
purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so 
slight and trivial a nature. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller; 

rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in 
my every action to be guided by others' experiences: 
but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say 
it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight. 
Frenchman 
'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, 
and by such two that would by all likelihood have 
confounded one the other, or have fallen both. 
IACHIMO 
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference? 
Frenchman 
Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public, 
which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. 
It was much like an argument that fell out last 
night, where each of us fell in praise of our 
country mistresses; this gentleman at that time 
vouching--and upon warrant of bloody 
affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, 
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable 
than any the rarest of our ladies in France. 
IACHIMO 
That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's 
opinion by this worn out. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
She holds her virtue still and I my mind. 
IACHIMO 
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 

Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would 
abate her nothing, though I profess myself her 
adorer, not her friend. 
IACHIMO 
As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand 
comparison--had been something too fair and too good 
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others 
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres 
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she 
excelled many: but I have not seen the most 
precious diamond that is, nor you the lady. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone. 
IACHIMO 
What do you esteem it at? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
More than the world enjoys. 
IACHIMO 
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's 
outprized by a trifle. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if 
there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit 
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale, 
and only the gift of the gods. 
IACHIMO 
Which the gods have given you? 

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Which, by their graces, I will keep. 
IACHIMO 
You may wear her in title yours: but, you know, 
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your 
ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable 
estimations; the one is but frail and the other 
casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished 
courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier 
to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the 
holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do 
nothing doubt you have store of thieves; 
notwithstanding, I fear not my ring. 
PHILARIO 
Let us leave here, gentlemen. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I 
thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first. 
IACHIMO 
With five times so much conversation, I should get 
ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even 
to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
No, no. 

IACHIMO 
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to 
your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it 
something: but I make my wager rather against your 
confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your 
offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any 
lady in the world. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
You are a great deal abused in too bold a 
persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're 
worthy of by your attempt. 
IACHIMO 
What's that? 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it, 
deserve more; a punishment too. 
PHILARIO 
Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly; 
let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be 
better acquainted. 
IACHIMO 
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the 
approbation of what I have spoke! 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
What lady would you choose to assail? 
IACHIMO 

Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe. 
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring, 
that, commend me to the court where your lady is, 
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a 
second conference, and I will bring from thence 
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring 
I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it. 
IACHIMO 
You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy 
ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot 
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some 
religion in you, that you fear. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a 
graver purpose, I hope. 
IACHIMO 
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo 
what's spoken, I swear. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your 
return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my 
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your 
unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring. 
PHILARIO 
I will have it no lay. 
IACHIMO 

By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no 
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest 
bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats 
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off, 
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, 
she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are 
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more 
free entertainment. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles 
betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if 
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly 
to understand you have prevailed, I am no further 
your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she 
remain unseduced, you not making it appear 
otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you 
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with 
your sword. 
IACHIMO 
Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set 
down by lawful counsel, and straight away for 
Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and 
starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two 
wagers recorded. 
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS 
Agreed. 
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO 
Frenchman 
Will this hold, think you? 
PHILARIO 

Signior Iachimo will not from it. 
Pray, let us follow 'em.

SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace. 
Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS 
QUEEN 
Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers; 
Make haste: who has the note of them? 
First Lady 
I, madam. 
QUEEN 
Dispatch. 
Exeunt Ladies 
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs? 
CORNELIUS 
Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam: 
Presenting a small box 
But I beseech your grace, without offence,-- 
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have 
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds, 
Which are the movers of a languishing death; 
But though slow, deadly? 
QUEEN 

I wonder, doctor, 
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been 
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how 
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so 
That our great king himself doth woo me oft 
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,-- 
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet 
That I did amplify my judgment in 
Other conclusions? I will try the forces 
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as 
We count not worth the hanging, but none human, 
To try the vigour of them and apply 
Allayments to their act, and by them gather 
Their several virtues and effects. 
CORNELIUS 
Your highness 
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart: 
Besides, the seeing these effects will be 
Both noisome and infectious. 
QUEEN 
O, content thee. 
Enter PISANIO 
Aside 
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him 
Will I first work: he's for his master, 
An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio! 
Doctor, your service for this time is ended; 
Take your own way. 
CORNELIUS 
[Aside] I do suspect you, madam; 
But you shall do no harm. 
QUEEN 

[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word. 
CORNELIUS 
[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has 
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit, 
And will not trust one of her malice with 
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has 
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile; 
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on 
cats and dogs, 
Then afterward up higher: but there is 
No danger in what show of death it makes, 
More than the locking-up the spirits a time, 
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd 
With a most false effect; and I the truer, 
So to be false with her. 
QUEEN 
No further service, doctor, 
Until I send for thee. 
CORNELIUS 
I humbly take my leave. 
Exit 
QUEEN 
Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time 
She will not quench and let instructions enter 
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work: 
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son, 
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then 
As great as is thy master, greater, for 
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name 
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor 
Continue where he is: to shift his being 
Is to exchange one misery with another, 

And every day that comes comes to decay 
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect, 
To be depender on a thing that leans, 
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends, 
So much as but to prop him? 
The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up 
Thou takest up 
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour: 
It is a thing I made, which hath the king 
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know 
What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it; 
It is an earnest of a further good 
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how 
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself. 
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think 
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son, 
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king 
To any shape of thy preferment such 
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly, 
That set thee on to this desert, am bound 
To load thy merit richly. Call my women: 
Think on my words. 
Exit PISANIO 
A sly and constant knave, 
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master 
And the remembrancer of her to hold 
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that 
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her 
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after, 
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured 
To taste of too. 
Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies 
So, so: well done, well done: 
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses, 
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio; 
Think on my words. 

Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies 
PISANIO 
And shall do: 
But when to my good lord I prove untrue, 
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.

SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace. 
Enter IMOGEN 
IMOGEN 
A father cruel, and a step-dame false; 
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady, 
That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband! 
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated 
Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n, 
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable 
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those, 
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills, 
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie! 
Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO 
PISANIO 
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome, 
Comes from my lord with letters. 
IACHIMO 
Change you, madam? 
The worthy Leonatus is in safety 
And greets your highness dearly. 
Presents a letter 
IMOGEN 
Thanks, good sir: 
You're kindly welcome. 

IACHIMO 
[Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich! 
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare, 
She is alone the Arabian bird, and I 
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend! 
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot! 
Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight; 
Rather directly fly. 
IMOGEN 
[Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose 
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon 
him accordingly, as you value your trust-- 
LEONATUS.' 
So far I read aloud: 
But even the very middle of my heart 
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully. 
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I 
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so 
In all that I can do. 
IACHIMO 
Thanks, fairest lady. 
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes 
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop 
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt 
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones 
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not 
Partition make with spectacles so precious 
'Twixt fair and foul? 
IMOGEN 
What makes your admiration? 
IACHIMO 
It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys 
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and 

Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment, 
For idiots in this case of favour would 
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite; 
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed 
Should make desire vomit emptiness, 
Not so allured to feed. 
IMOGEN 
What is the matter, trow? 
IACHIMO 
The cloyed will, 
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub 
Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb 
Longs after for the garbage. 
IMOGEN 
What, dear sir, 
Thus raps you? Are you well? 
IACHIMO 
Thanks, madam; well. 
To PISANIO 
Beseech you, sir, desire 
My man's abode where I did leave him: he 
Is strange and peevish. 
PISANIO 
I was going, sir, 
To give him welcome. 
Exit 
IMOGEN 

Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you? 
IACHIMO 
Well, madam. 
IMOGEN 
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is. 
IACHIMO 
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there 
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd 
The Briton reveller. 
IMOGEN 
When he was here, 
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times 
Not knowing why. 
IACHIMO 
I never saw him sad. 
There is a Frenchman his companion, one 
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves 
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces 
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton-- 
Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O, 
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows 
By history, report, or his own proof, 
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
